# Agent Agency - Constitutional AI Agent System

## Overview

**Agent Agency** is a production-ready constitutional AI system that implements constitutional governance for autonomous agent operations. The system uses a council of specialized AI judges to provide real-time oversight, ensuring ethical compliance, technical quality, and system coherence through evidence-based decision making.

The V3 iteration delivers a **functional constitutional AI system** with a working core execution loop, constitutional governance, and monitoring capabilities. **The core task execution pipeline is operational** with real implementations for the main workflow, though many advanced features remain as TODOs. Built in Rust for performance and safety, it provides both CLI and web interfaces for task execution and system management.

This mono-repo contains multiple iterations examining different approaches to AI agent systems:

- **`iterations/v2/`**: TypeScript implementation investigating multi-component agent orchestration with external service integration
- **`iterations/v3/`**: **Production-ready Rust implementation** with constitutional council governance, multiple execution modes, and comprehensive monitoring
- **`iterations/poc/`**: Reference implementation examining multi-tenant memory systems and federated learning concepts
- **`iterations/main/`**: Reserved for stable research artifacts

**For V3 (Constitutional AI System)**:
- Rust 1.75+
- Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Node.js 18+ (for CAWS tools and web dashboard)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd agent-agency

# Install Node.js dependencies (for CAWS and dashboard)

```bash
cd iterations/v3

# 1. Start the database (optional - system has in-memory fallback)
docker run -d --name postgres-v3 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 postgres:15
docker exec -it postgres-v3 psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE agent_agency_v3;"

# 2. Run database migrations (if using PostgreSQL)

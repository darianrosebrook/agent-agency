# Agent Agency - Multimodal RAG System & Constitutional AI Governance

## Overview

**Agent Agency** is a comprehensive research framework that has evolved from constitutional AI agent governance into a full-featured **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** with integrated constitutional governance capabilities. The project now provides production-ready multimodal AI processing with real-time governance and decision-making.

This mono-repo structure supports progressive research through multiple iterations, with the latest V3 iteration featuring a complete multimodal RAG system that can process text, images, audio, video, and documents while maintaining constitutional governance principles.

This mono-repo contains multiple iterations examining different approaches to AI agent systems:

- **`iterations/v2/`**: TypeScript implementation investigating multi-component agent orchestration with external service integration
- **`iterations/v3/`**: **Production-ready multimodal RAG system** with constitutional governance, vector storage, and Apple Silicon optimization
- **`iterations/poc/`**: Reference implementation examining multi-tenant memory systems and federated learning concepts
- **`iterations/main/`**: Reserved for stable research artifacts

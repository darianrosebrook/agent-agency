## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**For V3 (Constitutional AI System)**:
- Rust 1.75+
- Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Node.js 18+ (for CAWS tools and web dashboard)
- Apple Silicon recommended for optimal performance

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd agent-agency

# Install Node.js dependencies (for CAWS and dashboard)
npm install

# Install CAWS Git hooks for provenance tracking
cd iterations/v3
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

### Quick Start - V3 System

```bash
cd iterations/v3

# 1. Verify compilation (includes CoreML safety checks)
cargo check -p agent-agency-council -p agent-agency-apple-silicon
# Should show 0 errors - Send/Sync violations resolved ✅

# 2. Start the database (optional - system has in-memory fallback)
docker run -d --name postgres-v3 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 postgres:15
docker exec -it postgres-v3 psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE agent_agency_v3;"

# 3. Run database migrations (if using PostgreSQL)
cargo run --bin migrate

# 4. Start the API server
cargo run --bin api-server &
API_PID=$!

# 5. Start the worker service (in another terminal)
cargo run --bin agent-agency-worker &
WORKER_PID=$!

# 6. Execute a task (core execution loop is operational with thread-safe CoreML)
cargo run --bin agent-agency-cli execute "Test the execution pipeline" --mode dry-run

# 7. Monitor progress via CLI
cargo run --bin agent-agency-cli intervene status <task-id>

# Cleanup when done
kill $API_PID $WORKER_PID
```

**Note**: The core task execution pipeline is operational with thread-safe CoreML integration. Send/Sync violations have been resolved through proper FFI boundary control. Many advanced features remain as TODO implementations. Use dry-run mode for safe testing without filesystem changes.

### CLI Usage Examples

```bash
# Dry-run mode (safe testing)
cargo run --bin agent-agency-cli execute "Add user registration" --mode dry-run

# Auto mode with quality gates
cargo run --bin agent-agency-cli execute "Implement payment system" --mode auto --risk-tier 1

# Strict mode with manual approval
cargo run --bin agent-agency-cli execute "Deploy to production" --mode strict --watch

# CLI intervention during execution
cargo run --bin agent-agency-cli intervene pause task-123
cargo run --bin agent-agency-cli intervene resume task-123
cargo run --bin agent-agency-cli intervene cancel task-123
```

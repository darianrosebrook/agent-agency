# Agent Agency - Research in Constitutional AI Agent Governance

## Overview

**Agent Agency** is a research framework investigating constitutional approaches to AI agent governance and orchestration. The project explores how specialized judge models can evaluate, constrain, and improve agent behaviors in real-time, addressing the fundamental challenge of trustworthy AI agent deployment.

This mono-repo structure supports progressive research through multiple iterations, examining different approaches to constitutional concurrency where agents coordinate through agreed-upon principles rather than competing for resources or following fixed hierarchies.

This mono-repo contains multiple iterations examining different approaches to constitutional AI agent governance:

- **`iterations/v2/`**: TypeScript implementation investigating multi-component agent orchestration with external service integration
- **`iterations/v3/`**: Rust-based implementation exploring advanced AI capabilities and hardware acceleration
- **`iterations/poc/`**: Reference implementation examining multi-tenant memory systems and federated learning concepts
- **`iterations/main/`**: Reserved for stable research artifacts

## Research Questions

This project investigates several key questions in constitutional AI agent governance:

### Constitutional Concurrency
How can AI agents coordinate through agreed-upon constitutional principles rather than competing for resources or following fixed command structures?

### Judge Model Effectiveness
What approaches to specialized judge models provide the most effective evaluation and constraint of agent behaviors?

### Runtime Compliance Enforcement
How can constitutional principles be enforced at runtime without compromising agent performance or flexibility?

### Hardware-Accelerated Governance
What optimizations are possible when leveraging Apple Silicon's Neural Engine for both agent execution and governance operations?

## Usage Examples

### **Enhanced Agent Registration with Memory**

```typescript
import { AgentOrchestrator } from "./src/services/AgentOrchestrator.js";

const orchestrator = new AgentOrchestrator();

// Register a worker agent with learning capabilities
const agentId = await orchestrator.registerAgent({
  name: "Data Processor",
  type: "worker",
  status: "idle",
  capabilities: ["process", "analyze", "learn"], // Enhanced capabilities
  metadata: {
    version: "1.0.0",
    learningEnabled: true,
    memoryProfile: "adaptive",
  },
});

console.log(`Agent registered with ID: ${agentId}`);
```

### **Intelligent Task Submission with Context**

```typescript
// Submit a task with context for memory-aware routing
const taskId = await orchestrator.submitTaskWithContext({
  agentId, // Which agent should handle this
  type: "process", // Type of task (matches agent capabilities)
  payload: {
    data: "sample input",
    options: { priority: "high" },
  },
  context: {
    query: "process customer data with privacy filtering",
    requiredCapabilities: ["data-processing", "privacy"],
    expectedOutcome: "filtered-dataset",
  },
});

console.log(`Task submitted with ID: ${taskId}`);

// Predict task success probability
const prediction = await orchestrator.predictTaskSuccess(taskId, agentId);
console.log(`Success probability: ${prediction.probability * 100}%`);
```

### **Advanced System Monitoring and Analytics**

```typescript
// Get comprehensive system metrics with trends
const metrics = await orchestrator.getSystemMetrics();
console.log(`Active Agents: ${metrics.activeAgents}`);
console.log(`Total Tasks: ${metrics.totalTasks}`);
console.log(`Completed Tasks: ${metrics.completedTasks}`);
console.log(`Failed Tasks: ${metrics.failedTasks}`);

// Get agent memory insights
const memoryInsights = await orchestrator.getAgentMemoryInsights(agentId);
console.log(`Agent Learning Rate: ${memoryInsights.learningRate}`);
console.log(`Capability Evolution: ${memoryInsights.capabilityEvolution}`);
console.log(`Cross-Agent Learning: ${memoryInsights.crossAgentLearning}`);

// Find similar agents for collaboration
const similarAgents = await orchestrator.findSimilarAgents({
  capabilities: ["data-processing"],
  minSimilarity: 0.8,
  excludeSelf: true,
});
console.log(`Similar agents found: ${similarAgents.length}`);
```

### **Memory-Aware Agent Learning**

```typescript
// Learn from task outcome
await orchestrator.learnFromTaskOutcome(taskId, {
  status: "success",
  performanceScore: 0.92,
  learnedCapabilities: ["privacy-filtering", "data-validation"],
  lessonsLearned: ["Improved data sanitization process"],
  executionTime: 1500,
  capabilitiesUsed: ["process", "analyze", "validate"],
});

// Get agent task history for analysis
const taskHistory = await orchestrator.getTaskHistory(agentId);
console.log(`Agent has completed ${taskHistory.length} tasks`);
console.log(
  `Average performance: ${
    taskHistory.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.performanceScore, 0) /
    taskHistory.length
  }`
);
```

### **Multi-Tenant Context Offloading**

```typescript
// Initialize multi-tenant memory system
const tenantId = "project-alpha";
const multiTenantMemory = new MultiTenantMemoryManager(config);

// Offload complex context to prevent LLM context rot
const contextRef = await multiTenantMemory.offloadContext(tenantId, {
  task: "complex-data-analysis",
  requirements: ["privacy-compliance", "performance-optimization"],
  historicalPatterns: ["similar-analysis-2024-01", "data-validation-2024-02"],
  constraints: ["gdpr-compliant", "sub-500ms-response"],
});

// Later retrieve and reconstruct context for new similar task
const reconstructedContext = await multiTenantMemory.retrieveContext(
  contextRef,
  tenantId
);

// Use federated learning insights across projects
const federatedInsights = await multiTenantMemory.getFederatedInsights(
  tenantId,
  currentTaskContext
);
console.log(`Found ${federatedInsights.length} cross-project insights`);
```

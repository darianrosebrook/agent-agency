# Agent Agency - Research in Constitutional AI Agent Governance

## Overview

**Agent Agency** is a research framework investigating constitutional approaches to AI agent governance and orchestration. The project explores how specialized judge models can evaluate, constrain, and improve agent behaviors in real-time, addressing the fundamental challenge of trustworthy AI agent deployment.

This mono-repo structure supports progressive research through multiple iterations, examining different approaches to constitutional concurrency where agents coordinate through agreed-upon principles rather than competing for resources or following fixed hierarchies.

This mono-repo contains multiple iterations examining different approaches to constitutional AI agent governance:

- **`iterations/v2/`**: TypeScript implementation investigating multi-component agent orchestration with external service integration
- **`iterations/v3/`**: Rust-based implementation exploring advanced AI capabilities and hardware acceleration
- **`iterations/poc/`**: Reference implementation examining multi-tenant memory systems and federated learning concepts
- **`iterations/main/`**: Reserved for stable research artifacts

## Research Questions

This project investigates several key questions in constitutional AI agent governance:

### Constitutional Concurrency
How can AI agents coordinate through agreed-upon constitutional principles rather than competing for resources or following fixed command structures?

### Judge Model Effectiveness
What approaches to specialized judge models provide the most effective evaluation and constraint of agent behaviors?

### Runtime Compliance Enforcement
How can constitutional principles be enforced at runtime without compromising agent performance or flexibility?

### Hardware-Accelerated Governance
What optimizations are possible when leveraging Apple Silicon's Neural Engine for both agent execution and governance operations?

## Purpose

These documents support project management and development tracking but are not part of the core system architecture. They are maintained separately to keep the main documentation focused on maintainable, architectural content.

## Maintenance

- Documents in this directory are archived and not actively maintained
- They serve as historical reference for project development
- Core architectural documentation remains in `/docs/` directory

## üß† **Phase 3: Intelligence (Weeks 7-9) - Learning & Adaptation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Goal**: Make the system learn from its own behavior.

**Testing**: ‚úÖ Queue behavior tests, dedupe validation, rate limit enforcement, scope enforcement

### 3.2 **Model Selection Bandits** ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Priority**: Medium - Optimizes provider choice

**Status**: Not yet implemented - requires LinUCB algorithm and context vector design

**Plan**:
- Upgrade from epsilon-greedy to LinUCB bandit algorithm

### 4.2 **CLI Guardrails & Dashboard** ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Priority**: Medium - Developer experience

**Status**: Not yet implemented - requires CLI interface and dashboard components

**Plan**:
- `--strict`: Ask for approval on each ChangeSet
- `--auto`: Apply automatically, promote only if gates pass
- `--dry-run`: Generate diffs, never apply

**Dashboard enhancements**:
- Iteration history with scores, stop reasons, file changes
- Diff viewer with accept/rollback controls
- Performance metrics per iteration

**Risk**: Low - UI/CLI improvements, core logic unchanged
**Testing**: CLI integration tests, dashboard E2E tests

## üîç **Phase 5: Validation (Week 12) - Prove It Works**

**Acceptance Checks** (from expert review):

1. ‚úÖ **Deterministic apply/rollback**: Same task+repo ‚Üí identical ChangeSets, clean reverts *(IMPLEMENTED)*
2. ‚úÖ **Hysteresis works**: Stops on plateau, no continue/stop ping-pong *(IMPLEMENTED)*
3. ‚è≥ **Strict/auto modes**: Strict requires approval, auto requires gate passage *(PENDING)*
4. ‚è≥ **Provider swap resilience**: Mid-loop swaps don't degrade success rate *(PENDING - depends on Model Selection Bandits)*
5. ‚úÖ **Frontier bounded**: Spawned tasks stay within limits, dedupe prevents growth *(IMPLEMENTED)*

**Implementation Status**: **3/5 acceptance checks implemented**
- ‚úÖ File operations are now deterministic with content hashing and clean rollbacks
- ‚úÖ Hysteresis prevents continue/stop oscillation with sliding window analysis
- ‚úÖ Frontier queue enforces rate limits, deduplication, and scope boundaries
- ‚è≥ Strict/auto modes require CLI guardrails implementation
- ‚è≥ Provider swap resilience requires model selection bandits

**Testing Strategy**:
- Red-team suite: Evil prompts testing guardrails
- Performance benchmarking: Compare with manual iteration
- Real codebase trials: Start with controlled TypeScript/Rust projects

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Mitigation**

**Technical Risks**:
- **File ops complexity**: Start with simple patch application, add AST diff later
- **Workspace abstraction leaks**: Keep workspace logic isolated, test both strategies thoroughly
- **Performance impact**: Profile workspace operations, optimize hot paths

**Process Risks**:
- **Scope creep**: Stick to concrete suggestions, defer nice-to-haves
- **Breaking changes**: All changes additive, maintain backward compatibility
- **Testing gaps**: Comprehensive integration tests before promotion

---

## üöÄ **Immediate Next Steps**

**‚úÖ COMPLETED: Major autonomous agent infrastructure is now in place**

1. **Complete budget enforcement** - Finish tool boundary blocking and waiver requests
2. **Implement CLI guardrails** - Add --strict/--auto/--dry-run modes
3. **Consider model selection bandits** - Optional optimization for provider selection
4. **Integration testing** - Validate end-to-end autonomous workflows
5. **Production deployment preparation** - Update deployment configs for new features

**Remaining Work**: 2 features (~15% of total scope) - focused on safety controls and optimization

This plan transforms our V3 architecture from "promising design" to "production-ready autonomous agent" by addressing the exact gaps identified in the expert review. The phased approach ensures we build reliability incrementally without disrupting our current momentum.

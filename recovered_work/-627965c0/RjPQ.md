# Autonomous File Editing Edge Case Analysis

## Overview
Comprehensive analysis of edge cases, failure modes, and potential holes in the end-to-end autonomous file editing system.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Unsafe Error Handling (CRITICAL)
**Location**: Multiple files with `unwrap()`/`expect()` calls in production code
**Impact**: System can panic and crash instead of gracefully handling errors

#### Specific Instances:
- `caws/waiver_generator.rs:152` - Waiver storage retrieval can panic
- `models/ollama.rs:209` - HTTP error response reading can panic (FIXED)
- `loop_controller.rs` - Multiple unwraps in core logic

#### Fix Required:
- Replace all `unwrap()` with proper error handling
- Add `#[deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` lint rule
- Implement graceful degradation for recoverable errors

### 2. Context Window Management Holes
**Issue**: No protection against context overflow in refinement loops
**Impact**: System can get stuck in infinite refinement loops

#### Specific Problems:
- Model generates responses that exceed context window
- Refinement prompts accumulate without bounds checking
- No detection of diminishing returns in refinement

#### Missing Safeguards:
- Context utilization tracking
- Automatic prompt truncation strategies
- Refinement quality plateau detection

### 3. Race Conditions in File Operations
**Issue**: Concurrent file access without proper locking
**Impact**: File corruption, inconsistent state

#### Specific Areas:
- WorkspaceManager applies changes without exclusive access
- Git operations can conflict with external modifications
- Snapshot operations during active editing

#### Missing Protections:
- File-level locking during operations
- Atomicity guarantees across multi-file changes
- Conflict detection and resolution

### 4. Malformed Model Output Handling
**Issue**: No validation of model-generated actions before execution
**Impact**: System can execute invalid or dangerous operations

#### Missing Validations:
- Action schema validation beyond JSON structure
- Path safety checks (no `..`, absolute paths, symlinks)
- Content size limits
- Binary file detection and rejection

### 5. Evaluation System Brittleness
**Issue**: Evaluation failures can cause false negatives
**Impact**: System rejects valid improvements or accepts broken code

#### Specific Problems:
- Test flakiness not distinguished from real failures
- Environment-specific failures (missing tools, permissions)
- Performance regressions misidentified as correctness issues
- Long-running evaluations not interrupted

### 6. Recovery Mechanism Gaps
**Issue**: Partial failures can leave system in inconsistent state
**Impact**: Requires manual intervention to recover

#### Missing Recovery:
- Transaction-like rollback for multi-file operations
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- State cleanup on interruption
- Recovery from corrupted git state

## Medium Priority Issues

### 7. Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities
**Issue**: No limits on resource usage during operations
**Impact**: System can consume excessive memory/CPU

#### Missing Limits:
- Maximum file size for operations
- Memory usage bounds for large diffs
- CPU time limits for evaluations
- Concurrent operation throttling

### 8. Security Boundary Violations
**Issue**: Potential for path traversal and system file access
**Impact**: Unauthorized access to system files

#### Missing Security:
- Path canonicalization and validation
- Symlink following prevention
- Hidden file (.git, .env) protection
- System directory (/etc, /usr) blocking

### 9. State Consistency Issues
**Issue**: In-memory state can become desynchronized
**Impact**: Decisions made on stale or inconsistent information

#### Missing Synchronization:
- Cross-component state validation
- Cache invalidation on external changes
- State persistence across restarts
- Concurrent access protection

### 10. Observability Gaps
**Issue**: Limited visibility into system behavior
**Impact**: Difficult to debug and optimize

#### Missing Telemetry:
- Detailed error categorization
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Model behavior pattern analysis
- Decision rationale logging

## Edge Case Categories

### Evaluation Edge Cases

- Timeout handling
- Resource exhaustion during evaluation

### Refinement Edge Cases

- Context window exhaustion
- Plateau detection failures
- Maximum iteration limits

### Recovery Edge Cases
- Partial operation cleanup

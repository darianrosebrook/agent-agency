## How to Use These Documents

### For Team Leads / Managers

1. Read **EXEC_SUMMARY.md** (understand strategy + risks)
2. Review **P0_DAILY_CHECKLIST.md** (run daily standups from this)
3. Track blockers + escalate immediately
4. Expected outcome: Demo by EOW2

### For Frontend Engineers (P0-1, P0-4, P0-5, P0-6, P0-10)

1. Skim **EXEC_SUMMARY.md** (context)
2. Read **FAST_WINS_ROADMAP.md** (your P0 items in detail)
3. Open **P0_CODE_MAP.md** (file-by-file implementation guide)
4. For each item:
   - Find file locations in code map
   - Read "already exists" section
   - Copy code snippets and adapt
   - Write tests

### For Backend Engineers (P0-2, P0-3, P0-7, P0-8)

1. Skim **EXEC_SUMMARY.md** (context)
2. Read **FAST_WINS_ROADMAP.md** (your P0 items in detail)
3. Open **P0_CODE_MAP.md** (Rust patterns + SQL migrations)
4. Database first: Create migration 007 + pool
5. Then: Worker HTTP, audit trail, security

### For DevOps / Platform

1. Read **EXEC_SUMMARY.md** (understand dependencies)
2. Focus on **P0_CODE_MAP.md** (CI gate setup in P0-10)
3. Ensure test infrastructure ready (Docker, migrations, mock backend)

---

## Daily Standup Agenda (15 min)

Use **P0_DAILY_CHECKLIST.md** for this:

1. **Status board**: What's in Progress? What's blocked?
2. **Blockers**: Any issues? Need help?
3. **Next 24h**: What's the priority?
4. **Risks**: Anything that could slip?

Example:
```
Person A: "P0-3 database migration done, wiring pool now. On track."
Person B: "P0-1 proxy works. Starting P0-4 task API. Need backend contact for worker endpoint?"
Lead:     "OK, escalate that, I'll get the info. Any other blockers?"
```

---

## Making Code Changes

### Before You Code

1. Read your P0 item in **FAST_WINS_ROADMAP.md**
2. Check **P0_CODE_MAP.md** for your files
3. Note what "already exists"
4. Identify what you need to do

### While You Code

1. Follow patterns from **P0_CODE_MAP.md**
2. Add tests (unit + integration)
3. Run lints + typechecks
4. Run full test suite before PR

### Before You Submit PR

Use the **PR template** in **P0_DAILY_CHECKLIST.md**:
- What changed?
- Acceptance criteria met?
- Tests pass?
- Lints pass?
- Blockers for next item?

---

## Tracking Progress

Update **P0_DAILY_CHECKLIST.md** status board daily:

```
| P0-1 | DONE   | Alice | ‚Äî  | ‚úÖ |
| P0-2 | IN PROGRESS | Bob | ‚Äî | ‚è≥ |
| P0-3 | DONE   | Alice | ‚Äî  | ‚úÖ |
| ...
```

Commit changes to reflect current state.

---

## Risking Hitting a Blocker?

**Immediate steps**:

1. Note it in **P0_DAILY_CHECKLIST.md** (blockers section)
2. Escalate in standup
3. Reference the **mitigation** (in EXEC_SUMMARY.md)
4. **Pivot**: Is there a parallel P0 item you can work on instead?

**Example mitigations**:
- Backend not running? Use mock backend in Node (scaffold it quick)
- DB connection fails? Use SQLite locally; switch to PG later
- Worker endpoint undefined? Use curl to a mock endpoint first

---

## What's P0? What's NOT?

### In P0 (This Sprint)

‚úÖ Backend proxy  
‚úÖ Real task execution (worker HTTP)  
‚úÖ Database persistence (tasks + audit)  
‚úÖ Task API endpoints  
‚úÖ Real-time metrics (SSE)  
‚úÖ Chat WebSocket  
‚úÖ Governance (audit + provenance)  
‚úÖ Security basics (keystore + sandbox)  
‚úÖ Code quality gate (CI block for TODOs)

### NOT in P0 (P1/P2 Later)

‚ùå Core ML / Candle / ONNX  
‚ùå Advanced analytics (forecast, correlation, ML)  
‚ùå Vision/ASR (macOS bridges)  
‚ùå ONNX quantization  
‚ùå Workload profiling  
‚ùå Distributed tracing

**Reason**: Too many unknowns; would block the core loop. Defer after MVP.

## Success Criteria (At End of P0)

- [ ] Proxy + health check working
- [ ] Dashboard shows real task list from DB
- [ ] Real worker execution (not simulated)
- [ ] Cancel works + audit logs it
- [ ] Metrics update live
- [ ] Chat sessions persist
- [ ] No secrets in plaintext
- [ ] File ops sandboxed
- [ ] CI blocks TODOs
- [ ] **Full loop**: create task ‚Üí execute ‚Üí show result ‚Üí cancel/audit

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know where to start"

1. Find your P0 item in the status board
2. Read it in **FAST_WINS_ROADMAP.md**
3. Go to **P0_CODE_MAP.md** and find the section
4. Follow the "What You Need to Do" steps
5. Copy patterns from code snippets

### "I'm blocked on something"

1. Note it in **P0_DAILY_CHECKLIST.md** (blockers section)
2. Escalate in standup (don't wait)
3. Check if there's a parallel P0 item you can work on
4. Reference mitigations in **EXEC_SUMMARY.md**

### "I don't understand the acceptance criteria"

1. Re-read it in **FAST_WINS_ROADMAP.md**
2. Ask in standup (no dumb questions)
3. Check **P0_CODE_MAP.md** for test patterns

### "Code changes don't align with the roadmap"

1. Pause; read your P0 item again
2. Check if it's scope creep (P1/P2 sneaking in)
3. If so: defer to later sprint
4. Keep P0 lean

## Questions? FAQs

**Q: How long is this sprint?**  
A: 2 weeks (EOW1: demo with proxy + real API data; EOW2: full cycle + stakeholder ready).

**Q: What if we slip?**  
A: Identify blockers early. Escalate. Pivot to parallel items. Extend to week 3 if critical.

**Q: Can I do P1/P2 stuff while waiting?**  
A: **No**. P0 is tight. Stay focused. P1 starts after P0 ships.

**Q: How do I know if I'm done?**  
A: Read acceptance criteria in **FAST_WINS_ROADMAP.md**. Check off boxes. PR review with lead.

**Q: What about testing?**  
A: Unit + integration tests for every P0 item. No exceptions. Linter + typecheck before PR.

impact_level: low
mitigation_plan: 1. All changes are documentation and file organization only - no functional code changes\n2. Comprehensive testing of documentation links and references after reorganization\n3. Backup of current structure before changes\n4. Incremental commits to allow rollback if issues arise\n5. Manual verification of all documentation accuracy after changes

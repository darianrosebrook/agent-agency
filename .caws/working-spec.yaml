    given: current state,
    when: action occurs,
    then: expected result
  - id: GPT5-P1
    given: task submitted to ArbiterOrchestrator
    when: prompting engine processes task
    then: reasoning effort, agent eagerness, and tool budget are dynamically optimized

    given: complex task with XML instructions
    when: XMLPromptProcessor parses instructions
    then: agent adheres to structured prompting guidelines
  - id: GPT5-P3
    given: prompting engine encounters failure
    when: error occurs during optimization
    then: system gracefully degrades with conservative defaults

invariants:
  - System maintains data consistency
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Multi-tenant memory system is initialized
    when: Agent stores context data with tenant isolation
    then: Data is securely stored with proper tenant boundaries and can be retrieved only by authorized tenants
  - id: A2
    given: Agent orchestrator receives a task request
    when: Task routing decision is made with memory awareness
    then: Task is routed to optimal agent based on memory state, capabilities, and performance metrics
  - id: A3
    given: MCP server is running with evaluation orchestrator
    when: Agent submits work for quality evaluation
    then: Code quality is assessed against defined criteria and results are provided with actionable feedback
  - id: A4
    given: Data layer is operational with vector operations
    when: Similarity search is performed on stored embeddings
    then: Relevant results are returned with proper performance (P95 < 250ms) and accuracy metrics
  - id: A5
    given: Quality gates are configured for CI/CD pipeline
    when: Code changes are submitted through the pipeline
    then: All quality checks pass (linting, testing, coverage, mutation testing) before deployment

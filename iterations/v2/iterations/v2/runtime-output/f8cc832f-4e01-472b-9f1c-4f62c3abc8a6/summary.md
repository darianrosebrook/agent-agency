## Description
Fix compilation errors and code quality issues in the playground directory. The playground contains intentionally broken TypeScript, Rust, and Python files with various errors including: duplicate type definitions, type mismatches, missing imports, unused variables, wrong return types, missing error handling, inconsistent naming conventions, TODO/PLACEHOLDER/MOCK DATA comments, missing trait implementations, and indentation errors. Please fix all these issues to make the code compile and follow best practices.

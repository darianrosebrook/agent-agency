# Agent Agency V2: TypeScript Multi-Component Orchestration

## Overview

Agent Agency V2 investigates multi-component agent orchestration patterns in TypeScript, exploring how specialized components can coordinate to manage agent lifecycles, task distribution, and quality assurance.

This iteration examines approaches to agent orchestration through modular components that handle different aspects of multi-agent coordination.

## Research Focus

V2 investigates several key questions in multi-component agent orchestration:

### Component Architecture
How can agent systems be decomposed into specialized components that coordinate effectively?

### Orchestration Patterns
What patterns emerge when multiple components need to coordinate agent lifecycles and task distribution?

### Quality Assurance Integration
How can quality gates and validation be integrated into component-based agent orchestration?

## Component Categories

The implementation explores different categories of orchestration components:

- **ARBITER Series**: Core agent orchestration and reasoning components
- **RL Series**: Reinforcement learning and optimization approaches
- **INFRA Series**: Infrastructure and runtime support mechanisms
- **E2E Series**: End-to-end testing and validation patterns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ with ES modules
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Ollama for local model serving (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment (if using database features)
cp .env.example .env
# Configure database and model settings
```

### Running the System

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

This will start the multi-component orchestration system, allowing investigation of how different components coordinate agent operations.

## Component Architecture

The V2 implementation explores a modular architecture where agent orchestration is decomposed into specialized components:

### ARBITER Series Components
Core orchestration components that handle agent lifecycle, task routing, and decision-making.

### RL Series Components
Reinforcement learning approaches to agent optimization and performance improvement.

### INFRA Series Components
Infrastructure support for runtime operations, monitoring, and system management.

### E2E Series Components
End-to-end testing patterns and validation approaches.

## Research Findings

The V2 iteration investigates how component-based architectures can address challenges in multi-agent orchestration, including:

- **Component Coordination**: Patterns for effective communication between specialized components
- **Lifecycle Management**: Approaches to managing agent registration, monitoring, and cleanup
- **Task Distribution**: Algorithms for intelligent routing of tasks to appropriate agents
- **Quality Assurance**: Integration of validation and testing within component architectures

invariants:
  - Health monitoring does not significantly impact system performance
  - Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
  - Recovery actions are safe and reversible
  - Alert thresholds are statistically valid
  - Health state is accurately reflected in monitoring data
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: System components with health monitoring requirements
    when: System health monitor initializes with component configurations
    then: Health checks are established, metrics collection begins, and baseline health state is established
  - id: A2
    given: Component experiencing failure patterns
    when: Circuit breaker service detects threshold violations
    then: Component is isolated to prevent cascading failures and recovery process is initiated
  - id: A3
    given: System metrics showing performance degradation trends
    when: Predictive monitor analyzes historical data and patterns
    then: Potential issues are identified before they impact availability and preventive actions recommended
  - id: A4
    given: Component failure detected by health monitoring
    when: Automated recovery coordinator executes remediation
    then: Appropriate recovery strategy is selected and executed with success monitoring
  - id: A5
    given: Multiple components with correlated health metrics
    when: Health metrics collector aggregates and analyzes data
    then: System-wide health indicators are calculated and health dashboard is updated
  - id: A6
    given: Recovery action completes with mixed results
    when: Recovery coordinator validates outcome and adjusts strategy
    then: Success is measured, metrics are updated, and future recovery strategies are refined

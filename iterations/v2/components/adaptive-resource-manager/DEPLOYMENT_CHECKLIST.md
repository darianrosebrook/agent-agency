## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Adaptive Resource Manager Configuration
ARM_ENABLED=true
ARM_MONITORING_INTERVAL_MS=1000
ARM_LOAD_BALANCING_STRATEGY=least_loaded
ARM_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_RATE_LIMITING=true
ARM_ENABLE_AUTO_FAILOVER=true
ARM_MAX_ALLOCATION_DECISION_MS=50
ARM_ENABLE_CAPACITY_PLANNING=true

# Resource Thresholds
ARM_CPU_WARNING_THRESHOLD=70
ARM_CPU_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD=85
ARM_MEMORY_WARNING_THRESHOLD=75
ARM_MEMORY_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD=90

# System Health Monitor Integration
SHM_COLLECTION_INTERVAL_MS=1000
SHM_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS=2000
SHM_RETENTION_PERIOD_MS=10000
SHM_ENABLE_CIRCUIT_BREAKER=false
```

### Resource Requirements

- **CPU**: 0.1 cores minimum, 0.5 cores recommended
- **Memory**: 128MB minimum, 256MB recommended
- **Network**: Low bandwidth requirements
- **Dependencies**: SystemHealthMonitor, ResourceMonitor, LoadBalancer, ResourceAllocator

### Load Balancing Strategies

1. **LEAST_LOADED** (Default): Selects agent with lowest current load
2. **ROUND_ROBIN**: Cycles through available agents
3. **WEIGHTED**: Considers agent capacity and current load
4. **PRIORITY_BASED**: Prioritizes agents based on task priority
5. **RANDOM**: Random selection for load distribution

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Allocation Success Rate**: Should be >80% under normal conditions
- **Average Allocation Time**: Should be <50ms
- **P95 Allocation Time**: Should be <100ms
- **Agent Utilization**: Monitor CPU and memory usage
- **Failover Events**: Track frequency and success rate
- **Capacity Utilization**: Monitor overall system capacity

### Alert Thresholds

- **Critical**: Allocation success rate <70%
- **Warning**: Average allocation time >100ms
- **Warning**: P95 allocation time >200ms
- **Critical**: Agent utilization >90%
- **Warning**: Failover events >10/hour
- **Warning**: Capacity utilization >85%

### Health Check Endpoints

- **Health Status**: `/health/adaptive-resource-manager`
- **Metrics**: `/metrics/adaptive-resource-manager`
- **Capacity Analysis**: `/capacity/analysis`
- **Load Distribution**: `/load/distribution`

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (if critical issues)

1. Disable AdaptiveResourceManager service
2. Route traffic to previous version or fallback
3. Investigate and resolve issues
4. Re-deploy after fixes

### Gradual Rollback (if performance issues)

1. Reduce traffic percentage to AdaptiveResourceManager
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Adjust configuration parameters
4. Scale back up if issues resolve

### Rollback Triggers

- Allocation success rate drops below 70%
- Average allocation time exceeds 200ms
- System errors or crashes
- Memory usage exceeds 500MB
- CPU usage consistently above 80%

**ID**: INFRA-004  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13  
**Risk Tier**: 3

---

## Executive Summary

The Adaptive Resource Manager has not been started. This component would provide dynamic resource allocation, load balancing, and scaling decisions based on system load and agent capabilities. While useful for production optimization, it is not critical for core system functionality.

**Current Status**: Not Started  
**Implementation Progress**: 0/10 critical components  
**Test Coverage**: 0%  
**Blocking Issues**: None - not blocking other components

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- None

### Medium Risk

- **Complexity**: Resource management across distributed systems is complex

  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple, well-defined resource types and gradually expand

- **Integration Overhead**: Requires integration with many other components
  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Design clean interfaces and use standard patterns

### Low Risk

- **Performance Impact**: Resource management itself consumes resources
  - **Likelihood**: Low
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize for minimal overhead, use async operations

## Next Steps

1. **Determine priority** based on production load requirements
2. **If needed soon, create detailed specification**
3. **Design architecture with focus on modularity**
4. **Start with basic resource monitoring and load balancing**

## Status Assessment

**Honest Status**: ‚ùå **Not Started**

- ‚ùå No implementation exists
- ‚ùå No specification defined
- üü° Medium priority for production scale
- ‚úÖ Not blocking any critical path items

**Rationale**: This component has not been started and is marked as medium priority. While it would provide significant value for production deployments at scale, it is not required for the core system to function or for initial production launch. The system can operate effectively without this component initially, with basic load distribution handled by simpler mechanisms. This should be prioritized once the system is in production and scaling needs become clear.

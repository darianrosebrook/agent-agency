executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The Adaptive Resource Manager provides intelligent resource allocation, auto-scaling triggers, resource pool
    management, cost optimization, and utilization monitoring to ensure efficient resource usage across all Agent
    Agency V2 components while maintaining performance and controlling costs.
  scope:
    - Dynamic resource allocation algorithms
    - Auto-scaling triggers based on metrics
    - Resource pool management (CPU, memory, connections)
    - Cost optimization with budget constraints
    - Utilization monitoring and forecasting
    - Resource request queuing and prioritization
  success_criteria:
    - Maintain resource utilization between 60-80% optimal range
    - Reduce resource waste by 25% through optimization
    - Auto-scale within 30 seconds of threshold breach
    - Stay within cost budget 99% of the time
    - Zero resource exhaustion incidents

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Adaptive resource management requires sophisticated algorithms for scaling decisions and cost optimization. The complexity lies in balancing performance, cost, and reliability while preventing thrashing and resource exhaustion. AI can implement allocation logic but human oversight needed for scaling threshold tuning and cost budget policies."

  risks:
    - "Auto-scaling thrashing causing system instability"
    - "Resource allocation deadlocks under high contention"
    - "Cost budget overruns from aggressive scaling"
    - "Demand forecasting errors leading to resource shortages"

  opportunities:
    - "Established auto-scaling algorithms (Kubernetes, AWS)"
    - "Statistical forecasting techniques for demand prediction"
    - "Resource pool patterns proven in database systems"
    - "Cost optimization algorithms well-studied"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement hysteresis in auto-scaling to prevent thrashing"
    - "Use exponential moving averages for utilization metrics"
    - "Add comprehensive testing with simulated load patterns"
    - "Build cost budget circuit breakers"
    - "Implement priority-based resource allocation with fairness"
    - "Add demand forecasting with confidence intervals"

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The Model Performance Benchmarking component provides comprehensive evaluation of AI models across multiple
    dimensions including latency, accuracy, cost, and quality. It enables comparative analysis, regression detection,
    and performance dashboard generation to support RL training pipeline decisions and model selection optimization.
  scope:
    - Benchmark suite definition and execution
    - Performance metric collection (latency, throughput, accuracy, cost)
    - Comparative analysis between models
    - Regression detection with statistical significance
    - Performance dashboard generation and visualization
    - Integration with RL training evaluation
  success_criteria:
    - Execute benchmark suites within 60 seconds for standard tests
    - Detect performance regressions with 95% accuracy
    - Support comparison of 10+ models simultaneously
    - Generate performance dashboards within 5 seconds
    - Provide actionable insights for model selection

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Model benchmarking requires careful statistical analysis and fair comparison methodologies. The complexity lies in ensuring benchmark relevance, avoiding bias, and providing actionable insights. AI can implement benchmark execution but human oversight needed for benchmark suite design and regression threshold tuning."

  risks:
    - "Benchmark bias producing misleading comparisons"
    - "False positive regressions disrupting workflows"
    - "Performance overhead impacting training pipeline"
    - "Statistical misinterpretation in comparative analysis"

  opportunities:
    - "Established benchmarking methodologies from ML literature"
    - "Statistical testing libraries provide robust analysis"
    - "Performance data enables continuous optimization"
    - "Dashboard visualization helps identify trends quickly"

  recommendations:
    - "Use statistical significance testing for regression detection (p < 0.05)"
    - "Implement stratified sampling for fair model comparison"
    - "Include confidence intervals in all comparative analysis"
    - "Build extensive testing with known performance patterns"
    - "Add benchmark suite validation to prevent drift"
    - "Implement caching for repeated benchmark executions"

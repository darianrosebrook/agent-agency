## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional: Override default configuration
RUNTIME_OPTIMIZER_ENABLED=true
RUNTIME_OPTIMIZER_COLLECTION_INTERVAL_MS=10000
RUNTIME_OPTIMIZER_ANALYSIS_WINDOW_MS=300000
RUNTIME_OPTIMIZER_MAX_OVERHEAD_PCT=5
RUNTIME_OPTIMIZER_ENABLE_CACHE_OPTIMIZATION=true
RUNTIME_OPTIMIZER_ENABLE_TREND_ANALYSIS=true
RUNTIME_OPTIMIZER_MIN_DATA_POINTS_FOR_TREND=10
```

### Dependencies

- **Required**: SystemHealthMonitor (already integrated)
- **Required**: Logger (observability)
- **Optional**: PerformanceTrackerBridge (if available)

### Resource Requirements

- **Memory**: ~10MB base + ~1MB per 1000 metrics
- **CPU**: <5% overhead during normal operation
- **Storage**: No persistent storage required (in-memory only)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment

```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test

# Run production validation tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="production.*optimization"

# Verify no linting errors
npm run lint

# Check security vulnerabilities
npm audit
```

### 2. Configuration

- [ ] Set environment variables (optional)
- [ ] Verify SystemHealthMonitor is running
- [ ] Configure logging levels
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards

### 3. Deployment

- [ ] Deploy RuntimeOptimizer component
- [ ] Initialize with production configuration
- [ ] Start optimization engine
- [ ] Verify health status

### 4. Post-Deployment Validation

- [ ] Check health endpoint returns healthy status
- [ ] Verify metrics are being collected
- [ ] Confirm analysis is running on schedule
- [ ] Monitor performance overhead
- [ ] Test optimization recommendations

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Health Score**: Overall system health (0-100)
- **Active Bottlenecks**: Number of detected performance issues
- **Analysis Frequency**: How often analysis runs
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption over time
- **Response Times**: Analysis and metric recording times

### Alerts to Configure

- **Health Score < 50**: System performance degraded
- **Memory Usage > 100MB**: Potential memory leak
- **Analysis Time > 1s**: Performance analysis taking too long
- **Engine Disabled**: Optimization engine not running

### Logs to Monitor

- **INFO**: Engine startup/shutdown, configuration changes
- **WARN**: Bottleneck detection, performance issues
- **ERROR**: Analysis failures, integration errors
- **DEBUG**: Detailed metric collection and analysis

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (if needed)

1. **Disable optimization engine**:

   ```typescript
   optimizer.updateConfig({ enabled: false });
   ```

2. **Stop metric collection**:

   ```typescript
   await optimizer.stop();
   ```

3. **Remove from orchestrator** (if integrated):

   - Remove optimization hooks
   - Disable performance monitoring

4. **System continues normal operation** - No data loss

### Full Rollback

1. Revert to previous version
2. Restart services
3. Verify system functionality
4. Re-enable optimization when ready

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [x] **Metric Collection**: Performance metrics collected automatically
- [x] **Bottleneck Detection**: Performance issues identified
- [x] **Recommendations**: Actionable optimization suggestions provided
- [x] **Trend Analysis**: Performance trends tracked over time
- [x] **Health Reporting**: Comprehensive health status available

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] **Performance**: <10ms overhead, <500ms analysis time
- [x] **Reliability**: Graceful degradation, error handling
- [x] **Scalability**: Handles production-scale metric volumes
- [x] **Maintainability**: Clean code, comprehensive tests
- [x] **Observability**: Structured logging, health checks

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Week 1

- [ ] Monitor performance overhead
- [ ] Verify optimization recommendations
- [ ] Check memory usage patterns
- [ ] Validate integration with SystemHealthMonitor

### Week 2-4

- [ ] Analyze optimization effectiveness
- [ ] Tune configuration based on usage patterns
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements
- [ ] Plan future enhancements

### Ongoing

- [ ] Regular health checks
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security updates
- [ ] Dependency updates

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**: Check metric retention settings
2. **Slow Analysis**: Verify analysis window configuration
3. **No Recommendations**: Ensure sufficient data points
4. **Integration Errors**: Check SystemHealthMonitor status

```bash
# Check health status
curl http://localhost:3000/health/optimization

# View recent metrics
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics/optimization

# Get optimization recommendations

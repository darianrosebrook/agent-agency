  purpose: |
    The Runtime Optimization Engine provides continuous performance analysis, query optimization, intelligent caching,
    resource allocation optimization, and automated bottleneck detection and remediation to maintain peak system
    performance across all Agent Agency V2 components.

    - Query optimization with execution plan analysis
    - Intelligent cache management with eviction strategies
    - Resource allocation optimization
    - Performance profiling and analysis
    - Bottleneck detection and automated remediation
    - Performance recommendations and tuning
  success_criteria:
    - Reduce query latency by 30% through optimization
    - Achieve 70%+ cache hit rate for common queries
    - Detect performance bottlenecks within 1 minute
    - Provide actionable optimization recommendations
    - Zero optimization-induced regressions

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Runtime optimization requires careful performance analysis and risk mitigation to avoid regressions. The complexity lies in balancing optimization aggressiveness with safety. AI can implement optimization algorithms but human oversight needed for validation criteria and rollback thresholds."

  risks:
    - "Optimization introducing performance regressions"
    - "Cache management causing data inconsistency"
    - "Resource allocation conflicts"
    - "Profiling overhead degrading production performance"

  opportunities:
    - "Query optimization patterns well-established"
    - "Cache eviction algorithms proven (LRU, LFU)"
    - "Profiling tools provide rich performance data"
    - "Statistical analysis enables bottleneck detection"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement canary deployments for optimizations"
    - "Use established cache eviction strategies (LRU)"
    - "Add comprehensive validation before applying optimizations"
    - "Build extensive testing with performance regression detection"
    - "Implement automatic rollback on performance degradation"
    - "Add profiling sampling to reduce overhead"

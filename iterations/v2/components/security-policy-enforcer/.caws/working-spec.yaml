threats:
  - threat: Security vulnerabilities in policy enforcement
    likelihood: medium
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Comprehensive security audit, penetration testing, input validation tests
  - threat: Policy bypass through edge cases
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Exhaustive edge case testing, mutation testing for security paths
  - threat: Performance degradation under attack
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Rate limiting tests, DDoS simulation, circuit breaker validation

invariants:
  - All input validation is performed before processing
  - Security policies are immutable during enforcement
  - Failed security checks are logged with full context
  - No sensitive data appears in error messages or logs
  - All policy decisions are auditable
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Security policy enforcer with comprehensive test suite
    when: All security tests are executed
    then: Zero security vulnerabilities detected, 90%+ branch coverage achieved
  - id: A2
    given: Security policy enforcer receives malicious input
    when: Input validation is performed
    then: All injection attempts blocked, proper error handling, security events logged
  - id: A3
    given: Security policy enforcer under load
    when: Penetration testing is performed
    then: Rate limiting active, circuit breakers engage, no resource exhaustion
  - id: A4
    given: Security policy with various edge cases
    when: Edge case tests are executed
    then: All edge cases handled correctly, no policy bypass possible
  - id: A5
    given: Security policy enforcer in production
    when: Compliance validation is performed
    then: All security standards met, audit trail complete, no information leakage
  - id: A6
    given: Concurrent security policy enforcement
    when: Multiple policies evaluated simultaneously
    then: Thread-safe operation, no race conditions, consistent enforcement
  - id: A7
    given: Security policy updates
    when: Policy configuration changes
    then: Changes validated before activation, rollback available, zero downtime
  - id: A8
    given: Security incidents
    when: Policy violations detected
    then: Incidents logged with full context, notifications sent, automatic remediation triggered

threats:
  - threat: Security bypass allows unauthorized operations
    likelihood: low
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Defense in depth with multiple validation layers
  - threat: Data leakage through insecure access patterns
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Comprehensive audit logging and access monitoring
  - threat: Privilege escalation through policy manipulation
    likelihood: low
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Immutable policy definitions and strict enforcement

invariants:
  - All operations are subject to security validation
  - Tenant isolation is strictly enforced
  - Security events are comprehensively logged
  - Access controls cannot be bypassed
  - Security policies are immutable during execution
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Multi-tenant system with security requirements
    when: Security policy enforcer initializes with tenant configurations
    then: Security policies are loaded, access controls established, and audit logging begins
  - id: A2
    given: Operation request from tenant with access controls
    when: Tenant isolation manager validates request boundaries
    then: Operation is allowed only within tenant boundaries and cross-tenant access is prevented
  - id: A3
    given: File system operation with security constraints
    when: File system security guard validates path and permissions
    then: Operation is permitted only for authorized paths and safe file operations
  - id: A4
    given: API request with authentication and authorization requirements
    when: API security validator processes request
    then: Request is validated for authentication, authorization, and security constraints
  - id: A5
    given: Security-relevant operation or access attempt
    when: Audit logger captures security events
    then: Comprehensive audit trail is maintained with tamper-evident logging
  - id: A6
    given: Security policy violation or suspicious activity
    when: Policy enforcer detects and responds to threat
    then: Appropriate security response is triggered and incident is logged

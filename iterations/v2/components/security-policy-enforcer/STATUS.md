## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Security Vulnerability**: System operates without security controls

  - Likelihood: **CRITICAL** (no enforcement exists)
  - Impact: **CRITICAL** (system compromise possible)
  - Mitigation: **MUST IMPLEMENT** before production

- **Bypass Potential**: Complex to prevent all bypasses

  - Likelihood: **HIGH** without thorough testing
  - Impact: **CRITICAL** (defeats purpose)
  - Mitigation: Extensive security testing, penetration tests

- **False Positives**: Overly strict policies block legitimate operations
  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM** in initial implementation
  - Impact: **HIGH** (user frustration, workarounds)
  - Mitigation: Tunable policies, override mechanisms with logging

### Medium Risk

- **Performance Impact**: Security checks add latency

  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM**
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (user experience degraded)
  - Mitigation: Optimize hot paths, cache policy decisions

- **Policy Complexity**: Managing policies becomes difficult
  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM** at scale
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (operational burden)
  - Mitigation: Clear policy syntax, validation tools

## Recent Changes

- **2025-10-13**: Status document created - CRITICAL security gap identified

---

## Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Assess current security risks without this component
2. **Review working spec**: Ensure security requirements are comprehensive
3. **Design policy schema**: Define how policies are configured
4. **Implement policy engine**: Start with basic rule evaluation
5. **Add command filtering**: Block dangerous operations immediately
6. **Security testing**: Extensive testing required for Tier 1

---

## Status Assessment

**Honest Status**: 📋 **Specification Only (0% Implementation) - CRITICAL GAP**

**Rationale**: Complete CAWS-compliant specification exists but no implementation has been started. This is a **CRITICAL Tier 1 component** that enforces security policies and prevents dangerous operations.

**Why CRITICAL**:

- **No Security Enforcement**: System currently operates without security controls
- **Dangerous Operations Possible**: No blocking of harmful commands
- **No Access Control**: All agents can perform any operation
- **No Audit Trail**: Security events not logged
- **Production Risk**: Cannot deploy without this component

**Security Risks Without This Component**:

1. Agents can execute arbitrary dangerous commands (`rm -rf /`, etc.)
2. No prevention of data exfiltration
3. No rate limiting or abuse prevention
4. No access control between agents/tenants
5. No security event logging

**Production Blockers**:

1. Complete implementation (60-75 days estimated)
2. Comprehensive test suite (≥90% coverage, ≥70% mutation)
3. Security audit and penetration testing
4. Integration with orchestrator and agent execution
5. Policy definition and validation

**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Cannot claim production-ready without this

**Recommendation**: This is a CRITICAL security component that MUST be implemented before any production deployment. Start immediately after or in parallel with ARBITER-015 (Arbitration Protocol). Consider this a security debt that must be resolved.

**Risk Level**: **CRITICAL** - System is vulnerable without security enforcement.

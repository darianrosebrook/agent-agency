## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Security Vulnerability**: System operates without security controls

  - Likelihood: **CRITICAL** (no enforcement exists)
  - Impact: **CRITICAL** (system compromise possible)
  - Mitigation: **MUST IMPLEMENT** before production

- **Bypass Potential**: Complex to prevent all bypasses

  - Likelihood: **HIGH** without thorough testing
  - Impact: **CRITICAL** (defeats purpose)
  - Mitigation: Extensive security testing, penetration tests

- **False Positives**: Overly strict policies block legitimate operations
  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM** in initial implementation
  - Impact: **HIGH** (user frustration, workarounds)
  - Mitigation: Tunable policies, override mechanisms with logging

### Medium Risk

- **Performance Impact**: Security checks add latency

  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM**
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (user experience degraded)
  - Mitigation: Optimize hot paths, cache policy decisions

- **Policy Complexity**: Managing policies becomes difficult
  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM** at scale
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (operational burden)
  - Mitigation: Clear policy syntax, validation tools

## Timeline & Effort

### Immediate (Next Sprint)

- **Define security policy schema**: 5 days
- **Design architecture**: 3 days
- **Start policy engine**: 3 days

### Short Term (1-2 Weeks)

- **Audit logging**: 7 days
- **Threat detection**: 7 days

### Security & Testing (1-2 Weeks)

- **Test suite (Tier 1)**: 15 days
- **Security audit**: 7 days
- **Penetration testing**: 5 days

**Total Estimated Effort**: 60-75 days for production-ready

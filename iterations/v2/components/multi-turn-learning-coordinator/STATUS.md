## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Complexity of Multi-Turn State**: Managing conversation state is complex

  - Likelihood: **HIGH** (inherently complex)
  - Impact: **HIGH** (bugs affect learning quality)
  - Mitigation: Start with simple state management, iterate

- **Learning Quality**: Extracting useful lessons is non-trivial
  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM** (requires experimentation)
  - Impact: **HIGH** (poor learning = no improvement)
  - Mitigation: Use established RL techniques from RL-001/002/003

### Medium Risk

- **Integration Coupling**: Depends on multiple components

  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM**
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (maintenance burden)
  - Mitigation: Clear interfaces, minimal dependencies

- **Performance**: Analyzing long conversations could be slow
  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM** at scale
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (delays learning)
  - Mitigation: Async analysis, sampling strategies

## Next Steps

1. **Review working spec**: Ensure requirements are current
2. **Design architecture**: Multi-turn state management approach
3. **Start conversation tracker**: Begin with basic conversation state
4. **Integrate with RL pipeline**: Leverage existing RL components
5. **Build iteratively**: Start simple, add sophistication

---

## Status Assessment

**Honest Status**: 📋 **Specification Only (0% Implementation)**

**Rationale**: Complete CAWS-compliant specification exists but no implementation has been started. This is a high-value component for enabling continuous agent improvement through multi-turn conversation learning.

**Why Important**:

- Enables learning from complex multi-turn interactions
- Improves agent performance over time
- Essential for self-improving agent capabilities
- Complements RL pipeline (RL-001, RL-002, RL-003)

**Dependencies Ready**:

- ✅ RL Pipeline functional (can leverage for training)
- 🟡 Performance Tracker partial (can track metrics)
- ✅ Agent Registry complete (can link to agents)

**Production Blockers**:

1. Complete implementation (45-55 days estimated)
2. Comprehensive test suite (≥80% coverage)
3. Integration with RL pipeline and performance tracker
4. Multi-turn scenario validation

**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for agent learning capabilities

**Recommendation**: Start implementation after ARBITER-015/016 or in parallel with lower-priority components. The RL pipeline is functional, making this a good next target for development.

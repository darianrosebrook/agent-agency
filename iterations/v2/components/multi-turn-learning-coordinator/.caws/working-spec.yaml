threats:
  - threat: Context loss between iterations breaks continuity
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Context preservation tests, state management validation, recovery tests
  - threat: Iteration loops become infinite
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Loop detection tests, maximum iteration limits, circuit breakers
  - threat: Feedback generation errors degrade learning
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Feedback quality tests, validation checks, human-in-loop options

invariants:
  - Context is never lost between iterations
  - Iteration count is always tracked and limited
  - Feedback is always generated for completed iterations
  - Learning progress is measurable and auditable
  - Failed iterations do not corrupt state
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Multi-turn learning coordinator with comprehensive test suite
    when: All tests are executed
    then: 80%+ branch coverage achieved, all integration tests passing

    when: Multiple iterations are executed
    then: Context preserved across iterations, no information loss, continuity maintained
  - id: A3
    given: Multi-turn learning coordinator with iteration limits
    when: Maximum iterations reached
    then: Iteration stopped, feedback generated, learning captured, no infinite loop
  - id: A4
    given: Multi-turn learning coordinator generating feedback
    when: Iteration completes
    then: High-quality feedback generated, actionable insights provided, learning captured
  - id: A5
    given: Multi-turn learning coordinator with context preservation engine
    when: Context management is performed
    then: Efficient compression, relevant context retained, retrieval accurate
  - id: A6

    given: Multi-turn learning coordinator error conditions
    when: Iteration failures occur
    then: Graceful recovery, state preserved, error logged, continuation possible
  - id: A8
    given: Multi-turn learning coordinator tracking progress
    when: Learning metrics are queried
    then: Progress measured, improvements quantified, audit trail complete

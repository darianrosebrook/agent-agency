## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration with ModelBasedJudge

```typescript
import { ModelRegistry } from "@/models/ModelRegistry";
import { LocalModelSelector } from "@/models/LocalModelSelector";
import { ComputeCostTracker } from "@/models/ComputeCostTracker";
import { ModelRegistryLLMProvider } from "@/evaluation/ModelRegistryLLMProvider";
import { ModelBasedJudge } from "@/evaluation/ModelBasedJudge";

// Initialize registry
const registry = new ModelRegistry();
const costTracker = new ComputeCostTracker();
const selector = new LocalModelSelector(registry, costTracker);

// Register models
await registry.registerOllamaModel("judgment-llm", "gemma3n:e2b", "1.0.0");

// Create provider with quality requirements
const llmProvider = new ModelRegistryLLMProvider(
  {
    provider: "model-registry",
    model: "judgment-llm",
    taskType: "judgment",
    qualityThreshold: 0.85, // High quality required
    maxLatencyMs: 3000,
  },
  registry,
  selector,
  costTracker
);

// Use with ModelBasedJudge
const judge = new ModelBasedJudge(undefined, llmProvider);

// Perform judgment
const result = await judge.evaluate({
  task: "Summarize the text",
  output: "Brief summary...",
});

// Model performance automatically tracked
console.log("Score:", result.overallScore);
console.log("Model used:", llmProvider.getActiveModelId());
```

### Integration with Performance Tracker

```typescript
import { PerformanceTracker } from "@/rl/PerformanceTracker";
import { PerformanceTrackerBridge } from "@/models/PerformanceTrackerBridge";

// Initialize Performance Tracker
const performanceTracker = new PerformanceTracker();

// Create bridge
const bridge = new PerformanceTrackerBridge(registry, selector, costTracker);

// Record task execution
const taskId = performanceTracker.startTask("sentiment-analysis", "agent-1");

// ... perform task ...

performanceTracker.completeTask(taskId, true, 0.9, {
  modelId: "judgment-llm-id",
  taskType: "sentiment",
});

// Bridge to model registry
const executions = performanceTracker.getTaskExecutions();
bridge.recordFromTaskExecution(executions[0], "judgment-llm-id");

// Export model data for RL training
const trainingData = bridge.exportToPerformanceTracker(
  "judgment-llm-id",
  "sentiment"
);
```

### Hot-Swappable Model Selection

```typescript
// Record performance for multiple models
for (const model of registry.getAllModels()) {
  selector.updatePerformanceHistory(model.id, "judgment", {
    quality: 0.85,
    latencyMs: 1500,
    memoryMB: 256,
    success: true,
  });
}

// Provider automatically selects best model based on criteria
const llmProvider = new ModelRegistryLLMProvider(
  {
    taskType: "judgment",
    qualityThreshold: 0.8,
    maxLatencyMs: 2000, // Latency constraint
  },
  registry,
  selector,
  costTracker
);

// Model selection happens transparently
const judge = new ModelBasedJudge(undefined, llmProvider);
const result = await judge.evaluate(input);

// Different models may be selected for different criteria
console.log("Selected model:", llmProvider.getActiveModelId());
```

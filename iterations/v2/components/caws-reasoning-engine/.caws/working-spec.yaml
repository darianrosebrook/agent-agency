title: "Arbiter Reasoning Engine - Multi-Agent Conflict Resolution and Constitutional Debate"
version: "2.0.0"
mode: feature
risk_tier: 1
status: spec_complete

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The Arbiter Reasoning Engine implements multi-agent conflict resolution through structured constitutional debates.
    It coordinates multiple agents in evidence-based argumentation, aggregates evidence, forms consensus through
    democratic and weighted algorithms, resolves deadlocks, and ensures all debates reach definitive conclusions.
  scope:
    - Multi-agent debate execution with structured argumentation
    - Evidence aggregation and credibility weighing
    - Consensus formation (majority, weighted, unanimous)
    - Deadlock detection and resolution
    - Appeal handling and review processes
    - Agent role management (proponent, opponent, mediator)
  success_criteria:
    - Process 95% of debates to consensus within 500ms
    - Deadlock resolution success rate ≥ 90%
    - Evidence aggregation accuracy ≥ 95%
    - Support 100 concurrent debates
    - All debates produce traceable reasoning chains

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Multi-agent reasoning requires sophisticated state management and coordination logic. The complexity of evidence aggregation, consensus formation, and deadlock resolution demands careful algorithm design and extensive testing. AI can implement debate protocols but human oversight critical for consensus algorithm tuning and deadlock strategies."

  risks:
    - "Debate coordination complexity introducing subtle race conditions"
    - "Consensus algorithms vulnerable to gaming or exploitation"
    - "Deadlock resolution bypassing important constitutional checks"
    - "Evidence aggregation producing inconsistent credibility scores"

  opportunities:
    - "Established debate protocols from argumentation theory"
    - "Consensus algorithms well-studied in distributed systems"
    - "State machine pattern simplifies debate coordination"
    - "TypeScript async primitives support concurrent agent coordination"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement debate state machine with clear transitions and invariants"
    - "Use established consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos concepts adapted)"
    - "Include comprehensive integration testing with adversarial agents"
    - "Build extensive observability for debugging complex debate flows"
    - "Implement circuit breakers and timeouts for all agent interactions"
    - "Add property-based testing for consensus algorithm correctness"

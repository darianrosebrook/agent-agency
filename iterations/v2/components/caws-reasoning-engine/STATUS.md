2. **Implement Debate Protocol**: 7-10 days
3. **Build Consensus Mechanism**: 5-7 days
4. **Add Conflict Resolution**: 5-7 days
5. **Argument Quality Scoring**: 3-5 days (leverage RL-003)
6. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (‚â•90%): 5-7 days
7. **Integration with ARBITER-015**: 3-5 days

### Nice-to-Have

1. **Debate Visualization UI**: 5-7 days
2. **Debate Analytics**: 2-3 days
3. **Historical debate replay**: 3-5 days

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Blocked by ARBITER-015**: Cannot implement reasoning engine without arbitration protocol

  - Likelihood: **CRITICAL** (blocker doesn't exist)
  - Impact: **HIGH** (delays entire reasoning system)
  - Mitigation: Prioritize ARBITER-015 first

- **LLM Cost Explosion**: Multi-agent debates require many LLM calls

  - Likelihood: **HIGH** without optimization
  - Impact: **HIGH** (operational costs unsustainable)
  - Mitigation: Cache arguments, limit debate rounds, use smaller models for non-critical debates

- **Consensus Complexity**: Achieving consensus algorithmically is hard
  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM**
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (could lead to deadlocks)
  - Mitigation: Implement timeout fallbacks, weighted voting, human override

### Medium Risk

- **Performance**: Multi-LLM debates are inherently slow
  - Likelihood: **HIGH**
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (user experience degraded)
  - Mitigation: Parallelize where possible, show progress indicators

---

## Timeline & Effort

### Immediate (Next Sprint)

- **Wait for ARBITER-015**: Blocked
- **Create working spec**: 3 days (can start in parallel)
- **Research debate protocols**: 2 days

### Short Term (1-2 Weeks - after ARBITER-015)

- **Implement debate protocol**: 10 days
- **Build consensus mechanism**: 7 days

### Medium Term (2-4 Weeks)

- **Conflict resolution**: 7 days
- **Test suite**: 7 days
- **Integration**: 5 days

**Total Estimated Effort**: 30-40 days (after ARBITER-015 complete)

## Recent Changes

- **2025-10-13**: Status document created - component identified as critical missing piece, blocked by ARBITER-015

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create ARBITER-016 working spec**: Define debate protocols, consensus mechanisms
2. **Wait for ARBITER-015**: This component depends on arbitration protocol
3. **Design debate architecture**: Multi-agent coordination patterns
4. **Implement core engine**: Start with TDD approach for Tier 1 quality
5. **Integrate with arbitration**: Hook into constitutional decision-making

---

## Status Assessment

**Honest Status**: ‚ùå **Not Started** (Blocked)

**Rationale**: This is a critical Tier 1 component that enables multi-agent deliberation for complex decisions. However, it is blocked by ARBITER-015 (Arbitration Protocol), which must exist first. The theory document describes sophisticated debate protocols, but no specification or implementation exists. This is essential for advanced CAWS capabilities but cannot proceed until the arbitration protocol is functional.

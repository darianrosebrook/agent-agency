threats:
  - threat: Web scraping blocks or rate limiting
    likelihood: high
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Implement respectful crawling with delays and user-agent rotation
  - threat: Malicious content or security vulnerabilities
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Content sanitization and security scanning
  - threat: Information overload from broad searches
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Intelligent result filtering and relevance scoring

invariants:
  - All web requests include proper headers and rate limiting
  - Content extraction is performed in isolated environments
  - Search results are cached to reduce external API usage
  - Web traversal respects robots.txt and site policies
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: A search query requiring web information
    when: Web Navigator receives the query
    then: Search is executed and relevant results are returned within time limits
  - id: A2
    given: Web content needs to be extracted from a page
    when: Web Navigator processes the URL
    then: Content is safely extracted and sanitized
  - id: A3
    given: Search results need deeper exploration
    when: Web Navigator traverses linked content
    then: Relevant linked pages are explored and summarized
  - id: A4
    given: Web Navigator encounters rate limiting
    when: Multiple requests are made to the same domain
    then: System respects rate limits and retries appropriately
  - id: A5
    given: Web services become temporarily unavailable
    when: Web Navigator attempts access
    then: System degrades gracefully with cached results or error indication

threats:
  - threat: Circuit breaker false positives block healthy services
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Threshold tuning tests, false positive metrics, override mechanisms
  - threat: Predictive monitoring false alarms cause alert fatigue
    likelihood: medium
    impact: low
    mitigation: Prediction accuracy tests, alert thresholds, noise reduction
  - threat: Health monitoring overhead impacts system performance
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Async monitoring, sampling strategies, resource limits

invariants:
  - Health checks never block system operations
  - Circuit breakers fail open if monitoring fails
  - All health metrics are timestamped
  - Predictive alerts include confidence levels
  - Alert fatigue is minimized
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: System health monitor with comprehensive test suite
    when: All tests are executed
    then: 80%+ branch coverage achieved, circuit breaker logic validated
  - id: A2
    given: System health monitor detecting failures
    when: Component failures occur
    then: Failures detected promptly, circuit breakers activate, alerts triggered
  - id: A3
    given: System health monitor with circuit breakers
    when: Failure thresholds exceeded
    then: Circuit opens, traffic blocked, recovery attempted, automatic reset when healthy
  - id: A4
    given: System health monitor with predictive monitoring
    when: Performance degradation trends detected
    then: Predictive alerts triggered, remediation recommended, confidence scores provided
  - id: A5
    given: System health monitor integration with all components
    when: End-to-end health monitoring performed
    then: All components monitored, dependencies tracked, system health score computed
  - id: A6
    given: System health monitor under normal load
    when: Health checks executed
    then: Monitoring overhead <1%, no blocking, async execution
  - id: A7
    given: System health monitor error conditions
    when: Monitoring itself fails
    then: Fail-open behavior, system unblocked, monitoring recovery automatic
  - id: A8
    given: System health monitor dashboard
    when: Health status requested
    then: Real-time dashboard available, all metrics visible, trends displayed

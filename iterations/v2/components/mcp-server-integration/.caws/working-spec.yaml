title: "MCP Server Integration - Model Context Protocol Tool Exposure and External Client Support"
version: "2.0.0"
mode: feature
risk_tier: 2
status: spec_complete

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The MCP Server Integration component implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for exposing all arbiter
    capabilities as tools to external clients. It provides request/response handling, error recovery, authentication,
    authorization, and comprehensive tool management to enable seamless integration with MCP-compatible systems.
  scope:
    - Full MCP protocol implementation (tools, resources, prompts)
    - Tool exposure for all ARBITER components
    - Request/response handling with validation
    - Error handling and graceful degradation
    - Authentication and authorization
    - Rate limiting and quota management
    - Tool discovery and capability advertising
  success_criteria:
    - Support 50+ exposed tools with complete metadata
    - Request handling within 50ms P95 overhead
    - 99.9% uptime for MCP server
    - Support 1000 concurrent MCP client connections
    - Zero protocol violations

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "MCP server integration requires strict protocol compliance and robust error handling. The complexity lies in exposing diverse arbiter tools through a unified interface while maintaining security and performance. AI can implement protocol handling but human oversight needed for tool exposure design and security validation."

  risks:
    - "Protocol violations breaking client compatibility"
    - "Tool exposure design leaking sensitive capabilities"
    - "Authentication vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access"
    - "Performance bottlenecks under high client concurrency"

  opportunities:
    - "MCP protocol specification provides clear implementation guide"
    - "Tool registry enables dynamic capability exposure"
    - "Standard authentication patterns apply"
    - "TypeScript type safety enforces protocol compliance"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement comprehensive protocol compliance testing"
    - "Use established authentication libraries (JWT, OAuth)"
    - "Add extensive input validation for all tool parameters"
    - "Build load testing for concurrent client scenarios"
    - "Implement circuit breakers for tool execution failures"
    - "Add protocol version negotiation for backward compatibility"

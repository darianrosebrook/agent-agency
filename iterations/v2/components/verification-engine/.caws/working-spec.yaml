threats:
  - threat: False positive verification results
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Implement multi-source validation and confidence scoring
  - threat: Verification service becomes bottleneck
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Design for horizontal scaling and async processing
  - threat: Verification algorithm bias or blind spots
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Regular algorithm auditing and bias detection

invariants:
  - Verification requests are processed asynchronously to avoid blocking
  - All verification results include confidence scores and reasoning
  - Verification failures are logged but don't prevent information flow
  - Multiple verification methods are used for critical information
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Information requiring fact-checking
    when: Verification Engine receives the information
    then: Information is validated and confidence score is assigned
  - id: A2
    given: Multiple verification methods are available
    when: Verification Engine processes information
    then: Multiple verification approaches are applied and results aggregated
  - id: A3
    given: Information contains potentially false claims
    when: Verification Engine analyzes the claims
    then: False claims are identified with supporting evidence
  - id: A4
    given: Verification Engine is under load
    when: Multiple verification requests are processed
    then: System maintains performance through queuing and prioritization
  - id: A5
    given: External verification services are unavailable
    when: Verification Engine attempts validation
    then: System provides best-effort verification with reduced confidence

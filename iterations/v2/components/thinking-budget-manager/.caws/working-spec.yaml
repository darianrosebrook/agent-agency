executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The ThinkingBudgetManager implements adaptive token allocation for RL training, treating thinking as an optimizable resource.
    It allocates computational budgets based on task complexity to prevent resource exhaustion while maximizing training efficiency.
  scope:
    - Token allocation by task complexity (trivial/standard/complex)
    - Budget tracking and enforcement with hard ceilings
    - Task complexity analysis based on task surface
    - Integration with RL training pipeline
  success_criteria:
    - Allocate tokens correctly per complexity level (≤500/≤2000/≤8000)
    - Prevent budget exhaustion with hard ceilings
    - Track usage accurately across training sessions
    - Allocation decisions complete within 50ms P95

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Token budget management requires careful tracking and enforcement logic. While straightforward algorithmically, the concurrent access patterns and performance requirements demand rigorous testing. AI can implement the core logic but human oversight needed for performance optimization."

  risks:
    - "Race conditions in concurrent budget tracking"
    - "Performance overhead affecting RL training speed"
    - "Incorrect complexity assessment leading to poor allocations"

  opportunities:
    - "Well-defined algorithm with clear boundaries"
    - "Testable with deterministic inputs"
    - "Performance optimization opportunities clear"

  recommendations:
    - "Use atomic operations for budget tracking"
    - "Profile early for performance bottlenecks"
    - "Include extensive concurrent access tests"
    - "Implement circuit breakers for budget exhaustion"

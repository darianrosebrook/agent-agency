threats:
  - threat: Agent registry corruption leads to unavailable agents
    likelihood: low
    impact: high
    mitigation: Implement backup, validation, and recovery procedures
  - threat: Performance tracking data grows unbounded
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Implement retention policies and data aggregation

invariants:
  - Agent profiles remain immutable after registration except for performance metrics
  - Performance history updates are atomic and isolated per agent
  - Registry queries never block agent registration operations
  - All capability changes are versioned and auditable
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: A new agent with defined capabilities
    when: Agent registers with the registry
    then: Agent profile is created with capability tracking initialized and agent is queryable
  - id: A2
    given: Agent registry contains multiple agents with varying capabilities
    when: Query for agents by specific capability and task type
    then: Agents matching criteria are returned sorted by performance history success rate
  - id: A3
    given: An agent completes a task with measurable performance metrics
    when: Performance metrics are updated for the agent
    then: Agent's running average performance history is computed correctly and persisted
  - id: A4
    given: Agent registry contains agents with current load information
    when: Query for agents filters by utilization threshold
    then: Only agents with utilization below threshold are returned
  - id: A5
    given: Agent registry is operational with active agents
    when: Registry backup and recovery is triggered
    then: Full registry state can be restored with zero data loss

ai_assessment:
  confidence_level: 0.85
  uncertainty_areas:
    - Optimal data structure for high-frequency performance updates
    - Retention policy for historical performance data
  complexity_factors:
    - Concurrent read/write patterns for registry and performance tracking
    - Running average computation for performance metrics
  risk_factors:
    - Registry becomes bottleneck if query patterns are inefficient
    - Performance tracking data growth could impact storage

  data_migration: false
operational_rollback_slo: 5m
threats:
  - threat: Provenance data corruption breaks audit trail
    likelihood: low
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Cryptographic integrity tests, backup validation, recovery tests
  - threat: AI attribution detection false positives/negatives
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Pattern validation tests, ground truth dataset, accuracy metrics
  - threat: Unbounded provenance data growth exhausts storage
    likelihood: high
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Retention policy tests, cleanup automation, compression tests

invariants:
  - Provenance records are immutable once created
  - Cryptographic integrity is maintained for all records
  - AI attribution detection is reproducible
  - Retention policies are enforced automatically
  - Audit trail is complete and tamper-evident
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: CAWS provenance ledger with comprehensive test suite
    when: All tests are executed
    then: 80%+ branch coverage achieved, integrity verification passing
  - id: A2
    given: Provenance ledger recording constitutional decisions
    when: Decisions are logged
    then: Records created, cryptographic signatures applied, integrity verifiable
  - id: A3
    given: Provenance ledger detecting AI attribution
    when: Code changes are analyzed
    then: AI-assisted changes detected accurately, patterns identified, confidence scores provided
  - id: A4
    given: Provenance ledger with retention policies
    when: Cleanup is executed
    then: Old records archived, recent records preserved, storage within limits
  - id: A5
    given: Provenance ledger integration with Git
    when: Commit analysis is performed
    then: Commits analyzed, attribution detected, metadata extracted
  - id: A6
    given: Provenance ledger integrity verification
    when: Audit is performed
    then: All records validated, no tampering detected, chain of custody verified
  - id: A7
    given: Provenance ledger error conditions
    when: Storage failures occur
    then: Graceful degradation, backup available, recovery possible
  - id: A8
    given: Provenance ledger query operations
    when: Historical records are queried
    then: Efficient retrieval, filtering accurate, results complete

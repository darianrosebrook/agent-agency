executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The CAWS Provenance Ledger provides comprehensive cryptographic audit trails for all agent actions,
    constitutional decisions, and system events. It includes AI attribution detection, integrity verification,
    Git integration for commit analysis, and file-based storage with intelligent cleanup policies to ensure
    complete transparency and accountability.
  scope:
    - Cryptographic provenance tracking with hash chains
    - AI attribution detection with pattern matching
    - Audit trail integrity verification
    - Git integration for commit analysis
    - File-based storage with compression
    - Intelligent cleanup policies and retention
    - Query interface for audit trail analysis
  success_criteria:
    - 100% of constitutional decisions captured with provenance
    - Integrity verification success rate 100%
    - AI attribution accuracy ≥ 95%
    - Storage overhead < 1MB per 1000 events
    - Query response time < 100ms P95

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Provenance tracking requires robust cryptographic implementations and careful storage management. The AI attribution detection involves pattern matching and heuristics requiring tuning. AI can implement the core logging and storage but human oversight needed for attribution algorithm design and cleanup policy tuning."

  risks:
    - "Hash chain implementation errors compromising integrity"
    - "AI attribution false positives creating misleading audit trail"
    - "Storage growth outpacing cleanup efficiency"
    - "Performance overhead impacting system responsiveness"

  opportunities:
    - "Well-established cryptographic hashing libraries"
    - "Git integration provides rich commit metadata"
    - "File-based storage enables efficient compression"
    - "Pattern matching enables AI attribution detection"

  recommendations:
    - "Use established cryptographic libraries (crypto.subtle, sodium)"
    - "Implement append-only storage with hash chaining"
    - "Add comprehensive testing for integrity verification"
    - "Build AI attribution patterns from real examples"
    - "Implement incremental cleanup with backpressure"
    - "Add circuit breakers for provenance recording failures"

threats:
  - threat: Performance tracking data loss during system failures
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Implement data persistence, backup, and recovery
  - threat: Performance tracking becomes bottleneck
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Async processing, batching, caching strategies
  - threat: Unbounded data growth exhausts storage
    likelihood: high
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Retention policies, data aggregation, cleanup automation

invariants:
  - Performance metrics are never lost during collection
  - Metric collection does not impact system performance by >2%
  - All metrics are timestamped and ordered
  - Aggregation preserves statistical accuracy
  - Historical data is retained per retention policy
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Performance tracker with comprehensive test suite
    when: All unit tests are executed
    then: 90%+ branch coverage achieved, all tests passing
  - id: A2
    given: Performance tracker collecting metrics from multiple components
    when: Metrics are collected under normal load
    then: All metrics captured accurately, <2% performance overhead, P95 latency <30ms
  - id: A3
    given: Performance tracker under high load
    when: 1000+ concurrent metric collections occur
    then: Async processing handles load, no blocking, batching active, backpressure managed
  - id: A4
    given: Performance tracker with historical data
    when: Data retention policies are applied
    then: Old data aggregated and archived, recent data preserved, storage within limits
  - id: A5
    given: Performance tracker integration with all components
    when: End-to-end monitoring is performed
    then: All component metrics collected, correlations detected, dashboards populated
  - id: A6
    given: Performance tracker data persistence
    when: System restart occurs
    then: All metrics preserved, no data loss, collection resumes automatically
  - id: A7
    given: Performance tracker monitoring system health
    when: Performance degradation detected
    then: Alerts triggered, root cause identified, remediation recommended
  - id: A8
    given: Performance tracker generating reports
    when: Performance reports are requested
    then: Accurate statistics computed, trends identified, anomalies highlighted

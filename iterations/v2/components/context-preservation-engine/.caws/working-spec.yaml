threats:
  - threat: Context corruption leads to task continuity loss
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Immutable context snapshots and validation
  - threat: Memory leaks from unbounded context growth
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Semantic compression and retention policies
  - threat: Cross-session context pollution
    likelihood: low
    impact: high
    mitigation: Strict session isolation and access controls

invariants:
  - Context state is preserved immutably across operations
  - Session boundaries are strictly enforced
  - Context compression maintains semantic integrity
  - Memory usage is bounded and monitored
  - Context access is authorized and auditable
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Long-running task requiring context preservation
    when: Context preservation engine initializes for task session
    then: Context container is created, initial state is captured, and session tracking begins
  - id: A2
    given: Task progresses through multiple steps with accumulating context
    when: Context compressor analyzes and compresses state
    then: Semantic compression reduces memory footprint while preserving critical information
  - id: A3
    given: Task execution is interrupted and needs to resume
    when: Session state manager restores context from compressed state
    then: Task resumes with complete context integrity and no information loss
  - id: A4
    given: Context data contains sensitive or unnecessary information
    when: Context validator filters and sanitizes data
    then: Context is cleaned of sensitive data and optimized for storage and retrieval
  - id: A5
    given: Multiple concurrent sessions with shared context requirements
    when: Session state manager enforces isolation boundaries
    then: Sessions remain isolated while allowing authorized context sharing
  - id: A6
    given: Context reaches memory or time limits
    when: Preservation engine applies retention policies
    then: Least important context elements are archived or removed while maintaining continuity

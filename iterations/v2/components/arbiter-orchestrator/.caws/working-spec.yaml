title: "Arbiter Orchestrator - Main Integration and Constitutional Authority Runtime"
version: "2.0.0"
mode: feature
risk_tier: 1
status: spec_complete

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The Arbiter Orchestrator serves as the central nervous system of Agent Agency V2, coordinating all agentic activities under CAWS constitutional authority. It integrates task routing, constitutional validation, performance tracking, and agent management into a cohesive, self-regulating system that maintains constitutional compliance while optimizing performance.
  scope:
    - End-to-end task orchestration from request to completion
    - Constitutional authority runtime and decision enforcement
    - Integration of all ARBITER components (001-004)
    - Real-time system health monitoring and recovery
    - Constitutional feedback loop management
  success_criteria:
    - Process 95% of tasks end-to-end within 500ms total latency
    - Maintain 99.99% constitutional compliance across all operations
    - Support 2000 concurrent agent tasks with full orchestration
    - Achieve 99.9% uptime with automatic failure recovery

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Orchestration complexity requires careful integration of multiple components with strict ordering and failure handling. While AI can help implement individual coordination logic, the overall system integration and constitutional authority enforcement require human design to ensure correctness and prevent systemic failures."

  risks:
    - "Component integration complexity could introduce subtle race conditions"
    - "Constitutional authority must be preserved across all orchestration paths"
    - "System-level failures could cascade through poorly designed integration"

  opportunities:
    - "Well-established orchestration patterns exist (saga, circuit breaker)"
    - "TypeScript's type safety helps prevent integration errors"
    - "Comprehensive integration testing can validate system behavior"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement orchestration as a state machine with clear transitions"
    - "Use circuit breakers and timeouts for all component interactions"
    - "Include extensive integration testing with failure injection"
    - "Design constitutional checks as mandatory pipeline steps"
    - "Implement comprehensive health monitoring and alerting"

  - Likelihood: **CRITICAL** (missing dependency)
  - Impact: **CRITICAL** (defeats core purpose)
  - Mitigation: ARBITER-015 must be highest priority

- **No Multi-Agent Coordination**: Advanced use cases impossible

  - Likelihood: **CRITICAL** (missing dependency)
  - Impact: **HIGH** (limited functionality)
  - Mitigation: Implement ARBITER-016

- **Insufficient Testing**: Tier 1 component without Tier 1 testing
  - Likelihood: **HIGH** (estimated 20-30% coverage)
  - Impact: **HIGH** (production bugs likely)
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite required

### Medium Risk

- **Integration Complexity**: Many dependencies create coupling risk

  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM**
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (maintenance burden)
  - Mitigation: Clear interfaces, minimal coupling

- **Performance**: Complex orchestration could be slow
  - Likelihood: **MEDIUM** without optimization
  - Impact: **MEDIUM** (user experience)

## Status Assessment

**Honest Status**: üü° **Alpha (45% Complete) - CAWS INTEGRATION COMPLETE**

**Rationale**: Arbiter Orchestrator has successfully integrated CAWS constitutional compliance checking and ARBITER-015 Arbitration Protocol Engine. Tasks are automatically screened for violations and escalated to constitutional arbitration when required.

**Critical Blockers**:

1. **ARBITER-015** (Arbitration Protocol Engine) - **MUST EXIST FIRST**

   - Without this, no CAWS constitutional enforcement possible
   - Defeats entire purpose of Arbiter system

2. **ARBITER-016** (Reasoning Engine) - **REQUIRED FOR ADVANCED USE**

   - Without this, no multi-agent coordination or conflict resolution
   - Limits system to simple task routing only

3. **ARBITER-003** (CAWS Validator) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Without this, no pre-execution validation
   - Quality gate missing

**Current Capability**: Can delegate tasks to existing components (agent registry, task router) but cannot perform intelligent arbitration, enforce CAWS rules, or coordinate multi-agent workflows.

**Production Assessment**: Not production-ready. Even after unblocking, requires 50+ days of development to implement core orchestration logic, achieve Tier 1 test coverage (‚â•90%), and pass security audit.

**Recommendation**: Focus all resources on ARBITER-015 and ARBITER-016 before investing further in this component. The orchestrator cannot fulfill its purpose without these foundational pieces.

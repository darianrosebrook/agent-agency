title: Workspace State Manager - File System Operations and Dependency Tracking

  modules:
    - src/workspace

threats:
  - threat: Path traversal attacks allow access outside workspace boundaries
    likelihood: low
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Strict path normalization and boundary validation
  - threat: File operation conflicts cause data corruption or loss
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Atomic operations and conflict detection
  - threat: Dependency graph corruption leads to incorrect change tracking
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Graph validation and consistency checks

invariants:
  - All file operations are sandboxed within workspace boundaries
  - File modifications are atomic and recoverable
  - Dependency relationships are consistently maintained
  - Version control operations preserve git history integrity
  - Conflict detection prevents destructive changes
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Workspace with project structure and agent requiring file access
    when: Workspace state manager initializes with project boundaries
    then: File system is scanned, dependency graph is built, and workspace state is established
  - id: A2
    given: Agent requests secure file operation within workspace
    when: File operation handler processes request with path validation
    then: Operation completes successfully with proper encoding and security checks
  - id: A3
    given: Code changes introduce new dependencies or modify existing ones
    when: Dependency tracker analyzes changes and updates graph
    then: Dependency relationships are accurately maintained and conflicts are detected
  - id: A4
    given: Agent-generated changes need to be committed to version control
    when: Version control integrator stages and commits changes
    then: Changes are properly staged, committed with generated messages, and git history is preserved
  - id: A5
    given: Multiple agents attempt concurrent file modifications
    when: Conflict detector identifies potential conflicts
    then: Conflicts are prevented or resolved through merge strategies and notifications provided
  - id: A6
    given: Workspace integrity needs verification after operations
    when: State manager validates workspace consistency
    then: Integrity checks pass and any corruption is detected and reported

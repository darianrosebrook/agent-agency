## 💡 What Makes These Tests "Advanced"

### 1. Multi-Step Reasoning Required

Unlike simple code generation, these tests require:

- **Problem decomposition** - Break down complex tasks
- **Strategy selection** - Choose appropriate approaches
- **Trade-off analysis** - Evaluate pros/cons
- **Iterative refinement** - Improve through feedback

### 2. Genuine Difficulty

These aren't toy problems:

- **LRU Cache** - Real interview question
- **Code Refactoring** - Requires taste and judgment
- **System Design** - Open-ended with many valid solutions
- **Bug Analysis** - Requires debugging skills
- **Performance Optimization** - Needs algorithmic knowledge

### 3. Lenient Scoring

Advanced reasoning tests accept **partial solutions**:

- 30% threshold for refactoring (vs 80% for simple tests)
- 20% threshold for optimization (very hard)
- Recognizes that reasoning is valuable even if incomplete

### 4. Extended Thinking Time

- **5 iterations** (vs 3 for other tests)
- **60-second timeout** per iteration
- **Total up to 5 minutes** per problem
- Allows the agent to "noodle on it"

## 🧪 Reasoning Quality Examples

### Example 1: LRU Cache Approach

```typescript
/**
 * LRU Cache Implementation (Improved)
 *
 * Approach: Doubly-linked list + HashMap for true O(1) operations
 *
 * Reasoning:
 * 1. HashMap for O(1) key lookup
 * 2. Doubly-linked list for O(1) add/remove
 * 3. Most recent at tail, least recent at head
 *
 * Improvements from previous iteration:
 * - More explicit node management
 * - Better memory efficiency
 * - Clearer separation of concerns
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
 * Space Complexity: O(capacity)
 */
```

### Example 2: System Design Reasoning

```typescript
/**
 * System Design: Task Queue
 *
 * Architecture Overview:
 * - Component-based design
 * - Clear separation of concerns
 * - Scalable and maintainable
 *
 * Components:
 * 1. Data Layer: Repository pattern for data access
 * 2. Business Logic: Service layer for core operations
 * 3. API Layer: RESTful endpoints
 * 4. Presentation: React components
 *
 * Reasoning:
 * - Layered architecture enables independent scaling
 * - Repository pattern abstracts data source
 * - Service layer centralizes business rules
 * - Clear boundaries between layers
 */
```

### Example 3: Performance Optimization

```typescript
/**
 * Performance Optimization
 *
 * Original Time Complexity: O(n²)
 * Optimized Time Complexity: O(n)
 *
 * Optimization Techniques:
 * 1. Replaced nested loops with hash map
 * 2. Memoized expensive computations
 * 3. Used early returns to avoid unnecessary work
 * 4. Batch operations where possible
 *
 * Benchmarks:
 * - Original: 1000ms for 10k items
 * - Optimized: 50ms for 10k items
 * - 20x performance improvement
 */
```

## 🔧 Implementation Insights

### Why Mock Solutions?

For E2E testing, mock solutions allow us to:

1. **Validate the framework** - Test runner logic
2. **Fast iteration** - <5 seconds per test
3. **Deterministic results** - Reproducible outcomes
4. **Focus on evaluation** - Test scoring mechanisms

### Transition to Real LLMs

When ready for real LLM inference:

1. Replace `mockAdvancedReasoning()` with actual LLM calls
2. Use structured prompts with reasoning templates
3. Extract reasoning from LLM responses
4. Validate approach explanations

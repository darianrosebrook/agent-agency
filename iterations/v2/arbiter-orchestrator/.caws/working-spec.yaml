    impact: high
    mitigation: Implement timeout mechanisms and deadlock detection
  - threat: CAWS enforcement bypass compromises governance
    likelihood: low
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Immutable validation checkpoints and audit trails
  - threat: Performance tracking failure loses RL training data
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Implement data persistence guarantees and recovery mechanisms

invariants:
  - All tasks receive routing decision within timeout threshold
  - CAWS validation runs before any task completion acknowledgment
  - Performance tracking data is collected for all completed tasks
  - Agent registry queries never block task routing
  - Health monitoring detects failures within 30 seconds
  - Task state transitions are atomic and isolated
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Arbiter orchestrator is initialized with all component dependencies
    when: System initialization is triggered
    then: Agent registry, router, validator, and tracker are initialized successfully
  - id: A2
    given: Task request arrives at arbiter
    when: Task routing is initiated
    then: Task is queued, routing decision is made, assigned to agent, and decision logged
  - id: A3
    given: Agent completes task with result
    when: Task result validation is triggered
    then: CAWS validation runs, result is checked against budgets and quality gates, and verdict is recorded
  - id: A4
    given: Task passes CAWS validation
    when: Task completion is finalized
    then: Performance data is collected, agent metrics updated, and task marked complete with provenance
  - id: A5
    given: Task fails CAWS validation without waiver
    when: Enforcement decision is made
    then: Task is rejected with specific violation reasons and remediation guidance provided
  - id: A6
    given: Multiple concurrent tasks in queue
    when: Load balancing is applied
    then: Tasks are distributed across available agents based on utilization and capability
  - id: A7
    given: Agent becomes unhealthy during task execution
    when: Health monitor detects failure
    then: Task is reassigned to healthy agent and failure is logged with recovery action
  - id: A8
    given: Task execution exceeds timeout threshold
    when: Timeout detection triggers
    then: Task is canceled, agent is notified, and timeout event logged with context
  - id: A9
    given: Complete task workflow from submission to completion
    when: End-to-end integration test runs
    then: Task flows through routing, execution, validation, and tracking with all data collected

  uncertainty_areas:
    - Optimal task timeout thresholds for different task types
    - Health monitoring failure detection sensitivity
    - Recovery strategy effectiveness for various failure modes
    - Concurrent task handling capacity under load
  complexity_factors:
    - Integration of four major subsystems (registry, router, validator, tracker)
    - Complex state management for task lifecycle
    - Concurrent task execution coordination
    - Health monitoring and automated recovery
    - CAWS enforcement integration with validation pipeline
  risk_factors:
    - Central orchestrator is single point of failure
    - Complex integration increases surface area for bugs
    - Performance overhead from multiple subsystems
    - CAWS enforcement could block all work if misconfigured

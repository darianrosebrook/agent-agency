## Functionality Implemented

### Debate Lifecycle Management ✅

1. **Initialization**

   - Create debate session with topic and participants
   - Validate participant count (2-10 agents)
   - Assign agent roles (proponent, opponent, mediator, observer)
   - Configure consensus algorithm

2. **Argument Submission**

   - Submit arguments with claims, evidence, and reasoning
   - Validate argument structure and length limits
   - Calculate credibility scores
   - Track arguments per participant

3. **Evidence Aggregation**

   - Collect evidence across all arguments
   - Calculate source diversity
   - Detect evidence conflicts
   - Validate evidence quality

4. **Voting & Consensus**

   - Collect votes from participants
   - Support 4 consensus algorithms
   - Validate participation rates
   - Form consensus with reasoning chains

5. **Deadlock Detection**
   - Detect mathematically impossible consensus
   - Recommend resolution strategies
   - Track voting patterns

### Credibility Scoring ✅

Implemented multi-factor credibility algorithm:

- Evidence quality contribution (+0.3 max)
- Verified evidence bonus (+0.1 max)
- Reasoning quality (+0.1 max)
- Claim quality (+0.1 max)
- Disputed evidence penalty (-0.2 max)

### Consensus Algorithms ✅

Implemented 4 algorithms with full validation:

1. **Simple Majority**: >50% for votes
2. **Weighted Majority**: Weighted by agent credibility
3. **Unanimous**: All agents must agree
4. **Supermajority**: Configurable threshold (default 67%)

## Integration Points Documented

### ARBITER-016 Dependencies

**Implemented (no external dependencies yet)**:

- ✅ Self-contained debate infrastructure
- ✅ Type-safe interfaces
- ✅ Complete state management

**Pending Integration (Week 7-8)**:

- ⏳ ARBITER-015 (Arbitration Protocol): Constitutional authority
- ⏳ ARBITER-005 (Orchestrator): Orchestration integration
- ⏳ ARBITER-001 (Agent Registry): Agent capability queries
- ⏳ ARBITER-002 (Task Routing): Conflict routing

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Algorithmic Complexity

- **State Transitions**: O(1)
- **Argument Validation**: O(n) where n = evidence count
- **Evidence Aggregation**: O(n×m) where n = arguments, m = evidence per argument
- **Consensus Formation**: O(n) where n = participants
- **Conflict Detection**: O(n²) for pairwise comparisons

### Memory Usage (Estimated)

- **Debate Session**: ~5-10 KB per session
- **Argument**: ~1-2 KB per argument
- **Evidence**: ~0.5-1 KB per evidence item
- **Typical debate (5 participants, 10 arguments, 20 evidence items)**: ~30-50 KB

   - **Mitigation**: Prioritizing test creation next
   - **Timeline Impact**: May extend Week 4 by 1-2 days

2. **Integration Complexity**

   - **Risk**: Integration with ARBITER-015 and ARBITER-005 untested
   - **Mitigation**: Integration tests in Week 7-8
   - **Timeline Impact**: Factored into schedule

3. **Performance Under Load**
   - **Risk**: O(n²) conflict detection may not scale

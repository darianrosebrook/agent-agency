threats:
  - threat: Validation bypass allows non-compliant work to merge
    likelihood: low
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Implement immutable validation checkpoints and audit trails
  - threat: Quality gate false positives block valid work
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Implement configurable thresholds and human override with justification
  - threat: Waiver abuse circumvents CAWS policies
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Require multi-factor approval and time-limited waivers
  - threat: Provenance chain corruption invalidates audit trail
    likelihood: low
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Use cryptographic hashing and immutable storage

invariants:
  - All validation results are immutably recorded in provenance
  - Budget violations cannot be merged without approved waiver
  - Quality gate execution is idempotent and deterministic
  - Provenance chain maintains cryptographic integrity
  - Waiver approvals require human authorization
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Task result with file and line of code changes
    when: Budget validation is performed against working spec
    then: Violations are identified for max_files or max_loc breaches with detailed breakdown
  - id: A2
    given: Task result with code changes
    when: Quality gates are executed according to risk tier
    then: All mandatory gates run and results indicate pass/fail with specific failure reasons
  - id: A3
    given: Budget violation and waiver eligibility check
    when: Waiver creation is requested
    then: Waiver request is generated with required justification fields and routed for approval
  - id: A4
    given: Approved waiver for specific budget violation
    when: Validation rerun includes waiver check
    then: Previously failing validation passes with waiver annotation in provenance
  - id: A5
    given: Task validation results
    when: Provenance recording is triggered
    then: Immutable provenance entry is created with cryptographic hash linking to previous entry
  - id: A6
    given: Complete validation result
    when: CAWS compliance determination is made
    then: Result indicates compliant/non-compliant with actionable remediation steps
  - id: A7
    given: Risk tier 1 task with quality gate requirements
    when: Coverage and mutation score gates are evaluated
    then: Coverage must meet 90% and mutation score must meet 70% thresholds

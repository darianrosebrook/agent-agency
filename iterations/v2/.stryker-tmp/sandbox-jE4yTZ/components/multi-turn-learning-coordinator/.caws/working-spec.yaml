threats:
  - threat: Infinite iteration loops consume resources without progress
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Hard iteration limits, progress detection, and resource timeouts
  - threat: Context corruption across iterations breaks learning continuity
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Immutable context snapshots and rollback capabilities
  - threat: Feedback quality degradation leads to poor learning outcomes
    likelihood: high
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Feedback validation, confidence scoring, and automated feedback generation

invariants:
  - All iterations are bounded by hard limits or progress detection
  - Context state is preserved immutably across iteration boundaries
  - Feedback quality is validated before incorporation into learning
  - Learning outcomes are auditable and reproducible
  - Resource consumption is monitored and controlled
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Task requiring iterative improvement and agent with learning capabilities
    when: Multi-turn learning coordinator is initialized with task and agent
    then: Learning session is established with configurable iteration limits and context preservation enabled
  - id: A2
    given: Agent completes first iteration with detectable errors
    when: Error pattern recognition analyzes failure modes
    then: Specific error categories are identified and targeted remediation strategies are generated
  - id: A3
    given: Multiple iterations with feedback and error patterns
    when: Adaptive prompt engineering modifies prompts based on learning history
    then: Prompts incorporate successful patterns and avoid identified failure modes
  - id: A4
    given: Iteration reaches quality threshold or maximum iterations
    when: Learning coordinator evaluates completion criteria
    then: Session terminates with final result and learning summary documenting improvement trajectory
  - id: A5
    given: Context preservation across iterations is required
    when: Context preservation engine manages state transitions
    then: Semantic compression maintains coherence while reducing memory footprint
  - id: A6
    given: Agent requires structured feedback for improvement
    when: Feedback generator processes evaluation results
    then: Actionable feedback is produced with specific improvement recommendations and confidence scores
  - id: A7
    given: Learning session encounters resource constraints
    when: Iteration manager enforces limits and monitors progress
    then: Graceful degradation occurs with partial results and resource usage reporting

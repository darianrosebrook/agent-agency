# Agent RL Training: Continuous Improvement through Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

The Agent RL Training system uses benchmark data collected from arbiter orchestration to continuously improve agent capabilities through reinforcement learning. This closes the feedback loop—better agents lead to better performance, which generates better training data, which creates even better agents.

**Core Innovation**: RL training is not a separate offline process—it's an integral part of the system that consumes operational data and deploys improvements back to production.

### Prerequisites

**Before RL Training Begins**:

- ✅ Arbiter operational and collecting data
- ✅ ≥5,000 quality benchmark data points
- ✅ Data validation gates passing (≥95% clean data)
- ✅ Privacy compliance verified
- ✅ Task type diversity (≥5 categories)

**Why These Prerequisites Matter**:

- **Insufficient data** → Training won't converge
- **Poor quality data** → Agents learn bad behaviors
- **Privacy violations** → Can't use cross-tenant learning
- **Low diversity** → Agents overfit to specific tasks

## Training Pipeline

### Phase 1: Data Preparation

**Input**: Raw benchmark data from arbiter

**Process**:

1. Batch export from benchmark pool (5,000-10,000 points)
2. Quality validation (remove invalid data)
3. Anonymization (privacy compliance)
4. Balancing (ensure task type diversity)
5. Format conversion (RL trainer compatible)

**Output**: Clean, balanced, privacy-compliant training batch

### Phase 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Warmup

**Input**: High-quality examples (quality score ≥0.8)

**Process**:

1. Extract successful task completions
2. Format as input-output pairs
3. Train on correct tool usage patterns
4. Validate format learning

**Output**: Model with basic tool competence

### Phase 3: RL Fine-Tuning (GRPO)

**Input**: SFT-warmed model + diverse training batch

**Process**:

1. Generate trajectories from benchmark data
2. Compute turn-level rewards
3. Group trajectories by outcome
4. Calculate advantages using GRPO
5. Update policy network
6. Validate on held-out data

**Output**: Model optimized for multi-turn tasks

### Phase 4: Deployment & Validation

**Input**: Trained model

**Process**:

1. A/B test against current agents (10% traffic)
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Validate improvements (≥10% quality increase)
4. Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
5. Update arbiter agent registry

**Output**: Improved agent deployed to production

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    Implement GPT-5 prompting techniques for intelligent agent orchestration, including reasoning effort control,
    eagerness management, tool budgeting, and XML-structured instruction processing.
  scope:
    - Reasoning effort optimization (high/medium/low)
    - Agent eagerness calibration (proactive vs detailed)
    - Tool call budget management
    - XML-like syntax processing for structured prompts
    - Context gathering parallelization
    - Self-reflection rubric systems
  success_criteria:
    - Agent response quality improves by 30% with dynamic reasoning effort
    - Tool call efficiency increases by 40% with budget controls
    - Context gathering time reduces by 50% with parallelization
    - Complex task planning accuracy reaches 90% with self-reflection

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "GPT-5 prompting techniques represent a significant advancement in agent control. While the core concepts are sound, implementation requires careful calibration to avoid over-engineering simple tasks or under-engineering complex ones. The XML processing and parallelization features add complexity but provide substantial benefits for agent orchestration."

  risks:
    - "Complex prompting logic could introduce subtle behavioral bugs"
    - "Performance overhead from XML processing and parallelization"
    - "Calibration drift as GPT-5 evolves"

  opportunities:
    - "Significant improvements in agent efficiency and task quality"
    - "Better resource utilization through dynamic reasoning effort"
    - "Enhanced planning capabilities with self-reflection systems"

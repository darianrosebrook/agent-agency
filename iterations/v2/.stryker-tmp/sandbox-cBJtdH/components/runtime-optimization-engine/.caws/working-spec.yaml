rollback_plan: |
  1. Disable optimization engine via feature flag
  2. Stop metric collection
  3. Remove optimization hooks from orchestrator
  4. System continues normal operation
  5. No data loss - optimization data is advisory only

notes: |
  This is a Tier 3 (low risk) component that provides observability and
  optimization recommendations. It is not required for core system functionality.
  
  The engine focuses on:
  - Non-intrusive performance monitoring
  - Advisory recommendations (not enforced)
  - Graceful degradation if disabled
  - Minimal performance overhead
  
  Implementation follows incremental approach:
  1. Basic metric collection
  2. Simple bottleneck detection
  3. Recommendation engine
  4. Cache optimization analysis
  5. Trend analysis and predictions

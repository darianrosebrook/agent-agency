status: spec_complete

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The CAWS Arbitration Protocol Engine serves as the constitutional authority coordinator for multi-agent debates.
    It interprets CAWS constitutional rules, coordinates debate processes, generates reasoned verdicts, manages waivers,
    and provides appeal mechanisms to ensure all agent actions remain constitutionally compliant.
  scope:
    - Constitutional rule interpretation and enforcement
    - Multi-agent debate coordination and protocol management
    - Verdict generation with comprehensive reasoning
    - Waiver negotiation and time-bounded approval
    - Appeal and review mechanisms
    - Precedent tracking and application
  success_criteria:
    - All constitutional decisions rendered within 200ms P95 latency
    - 100% constitutional compliance across all verdicts
    - Zero false constitutional violations
    - Support 500 concurrent arbitration sessions
    - All verdicts include complete reasoning and evidence chains

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Constitutional arbitration requires precise rule interpretation and consistent enforcement. The complexity of coordinating multi-agent debates while maintaining constitutional authority demands careful state management and comprehensive testing. AI can implement the coordination logic but human oversight critical for constitutional rule definitions and precedent management."

  risks:
    - "Constitutional rule misinterpretation leading to incorrect verdicts"
    - "Debate coordination complexity introducing deadlocks"
    - "Waiver system exploitation bypassing constitutional constraints"
    - "Performance degradation under high arbitration load"

  opportunities:
    - "Well-defined constitutional rules enable automated interpretation"
    - "Debate protocols have established patterns from legal systems"
    - "Comprehensive audit trail enables precedent learning"
    - "TypeScript type safety prevents constitutional logic errors"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement constitutional rules as declarative, versioned data structures"
    - "Use state machine pattern for debate coordination"
    - "Include comprehensive property-based testing for rule interpretation"
    - "Build extensive audit logging for all constitutional decisions"
    - "Implement circuit breakers for debate timeout prevention"
    - "Add precedent validation to ensure consistency"

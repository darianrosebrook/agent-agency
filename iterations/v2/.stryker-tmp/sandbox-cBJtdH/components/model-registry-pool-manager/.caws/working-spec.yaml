status: spec_complete

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The Model Registry/Pool Manager provides comprehensive AI model lifecycle management including registration,
    versioning, performance tracking, pool management with warm instances, model selection algorithms, and cost
    optimization. It serves as the central authority for all AI model operations within Agent Agency V2.
  scope:
    - Model registration and metadata management
    - Version control and model lifecycle tracking
    - Warm instance pool management for performance
    - Cold storage for cost optimization
    - Model selection algorithms based on performance and cost
    - Performance tracking per model
    - Cost tracking and budget enforcement
  success_criteria:
    - Support 100+ registered models with versioning
    - Model selection decisions within 50ms P95
    - 95% warm instance cache hit rate for common models
    - Cost tracking accuracy within 1% of actual
    - Zero model version conflicts

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Model registry and pool management requires careful state tracking and cache management. The complexity lies in balancing warm instance pools for performance with cost constraints. AI can implement the management logic but human oversight needed for pool sizing algorithms and cost optimization strategies."

  risks:
    - "Pool management complexity introducing race conditions"
    - "Cost tracking drift accumulating errors"
    - "Model selection bias toward frequently used models"
    - "Memory leaks in warm instance pools"

  opportunities:
    - "Well-established caching patterns apply to warm instances"
    - "Model metadata enables sophisticated selection algorithms"
    - "Performance tracking provides data for optimization"
    - "TypeScript type safety prevents version conflicts"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement pool management with LRU eviction strategy"
    - "Use atomic operations for cost tracking"
    - "Include comprehensive monitoring for pool metrics"
    - "Build extensive testing for concurrent selection scenarios"
    - "Implement circuit breakers for model initialization failures"
    - "Add pool size auto-tuning based on usage patterns"

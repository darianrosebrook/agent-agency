# Agent Agency V2: Comprehensive RL Enhancement Summary

## Integrating Podcast Insights + Will Brown's Agent RL Framework

## Executive Overview

This document synthesizes insights from two key sources to create a comprehensive enhancement plan for Agent Agency V2:

1. **Podcast Discussion**: "Extended Thinking & Practical Reliability" (Anthropic's positioning, reward hacking, multi-turn tool use)
2. **Will Brown's Talk**: "RL for Agents: From Pipelines to Policies" (rubric engineering, environment abstraction, turn-level RL)

Together, these provide a complete framework for transforming our POC into a production-ready agentic RL system with measurable reliability improvements.

## 3. Key Architecture Enhancements

### 3.1 Rubric Engineering Framework (Brown's Core Contribution)

**Before**: Ad-hoc reward signals
**After**: Systematic, testable, versionable rubrics

```typescript
interface ComprehensiveRubric {
  // Format adherence (podcast: tool JSON schemas)
  format: WeightedRewardTerm & {
    jsonValid: SubTerm;
    xmlStructured: SubTerm;
    schemaCompliant: SubTerm;
  };

  // Tool correctness (podcast: dummy call prevention)
  tool: WeightedRewardTerm & {
    evidenceOverlap: SubTerm; // Retrieved data relevance
    callEfficiency: SubTerm; // Avoid redundant calls
    errorHandling: SubTerm; // Proper fallback behavior
  };

  // Task completion (podcast: multi-turn success)
  task: WeightedRewardTerm & {
    testPassRate: SubTerm; // Quality gates
    progressMetrics: SubTerm; // Subgoal completion
    oracleAlignment: SubTerm; // Ground truth matching
  };

  // Code minimality (podcast: reward hacking prevention)
  minimal: WeightedRewardTerm & {
    astSimilarity: SubTerm; // Tree-edit distance
    fileTouchCount: SubTerm; // Changed file limits
    scaffoldingPenalty: SubTerm; // Unnecessary abstractions
  };

  // Cost efficiency (podcast: thinking budgets)
  cost: WeightedRewardTerm & {
    tokenEfficiency: SubTerm; // Thinking token optimization
    latencyPenalty: SubTerm; // Time budget adherence
    apiCallCount: SubTerm; // Tool usage economy
  };

  // Safety compliance (podcast: system cards, scopes)
  safety: WeightedRewardTerm & {
    permissionCheck: SubTerm; // MCP scope validation
    policyAdherence: SubTerm; // Enterprise constraints
    escalationCorrect: SubTerm; // Human-in-loop triggers
  };
}
```

### 3.2 Environment Abstraction (Brown's Interface Standardization)

**Standardizes agent runtime as formal RL environment**:

```typescript
interface ComprehensiveEnvironment extends RLAgentEnvironment {
  // Task specification
  reset(task: TaskSpec): Promise<EnvironmentState>;

  // Multi-turn action execution
  step(action: AgentAction): Promise<EnvironmentStep>;

  // Observation formatting
  getObservation(): Promise<Observation>;

  // Reward computation (multi-term)
  computeReward(step: EnvironmentStep, surface: TaskSurface): number;

  // Termination conditions
  isTerminal(): boolean;

  // Metadata for analysis
  getMetadata(): EnvironmentMetadata;
}

interface AgentAction {
  type: "think" | "tool_call" | "plan" | "commit" | "verify";
  payload: any;
  thinkingBudget?: ThinkingBudget;
  toolConstraints?: ToolConstraints;
}
```

### 3.3 Multi-Surface Reward Weighting

**Different optimization goals for different task types**:

```typescript
const surfaceConfigurations: Record<TaskSurface, RubricWeights> = {
  "code-editing": {
    format: 0.2, // JSON structure important
    tool: 0.25, // File operations, test running
    task: 0.4, // Test passing critical
    minimal: 0.1, // Code cleanliness matters
    cost: 0.05, // Efficiency secondary
  },

  "research-assistant": {
    format: 0.15, // Structured output needed
    tool: 0.35, // Search, API calls primary
    task: 0.3, // Information synthesis
    minimal: 0.05, // Conciseness less critical
    cost: 0.15, // API costs matter
  },

  "data-analysis": {
    format: 0.25, // Schema compliance key
    tool: 0.3, // Database queries, computations
    task: 0.35, // Accuracy verification
    minimal: 0.05, // Intermediate results ok
    cost: 0.05, // Compute costs monitored
  },
};
```

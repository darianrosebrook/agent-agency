threats:
  - threat: Fact-checking algorithms produce false negatives
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Comprehensive validation tests, ground truth datasets, accuracy metrics
  - threat: Credibility scoring bias
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Diverse source validation, bias detection tests, scoring calibration
  - threat: Verification delays block task completion
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Async verification, timeout handling, partial result strategies

invariants:
  - All facts are verified against multiple sources
  - Credibility scores are reproducible
  - Verification results include confidence levels
  - Failed verifications do not block task completion
  - Verification history is maintained for audit
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Verification engine with comprehensive test suite
    when: All tests are executed
    then: 80%+ branch coverage achieved, accuracy benchmarks met
  - id: A2
    given: Verification engine with ground truth dataset
    when: Fact-checking is performed
    then: >95% accuracy achieved, false positive rate <5%, false negative rate <3%
  - id: A3
    given: Verification engine scoring source credibility
    when: Multiple sources evaluated
    then: Consistent scores, reproducible results, bias metrics within limits
  - id: A4
    given: Verification engine under load
    when: Concurrent verification requests occur
    then: Async processing active, no blocking, timeouts handled gracefully
  - id: A5
    given: Verification engine with conflicting sources
    when: Sources provide contradictory information
    then: Conflicts identified, confidence adjusted, human review flagged if needed
  - id: A6
    given: Verification engine integration with knowledge seeker
    when: End-to-end fact-checking workflow executed
    then: Facts verified, sources scored, results returned with confidence
  - id: A7
    given: Verification engine error conditions
    when: Source unavailability or errors occur
    then: Graceful degradation, partial verification, errors logged
  - id: A8
    given: Verification engine audit trail
    when: Verification history is queried
    then: Complete audit trail available, all decisions traceable, metadata preserved

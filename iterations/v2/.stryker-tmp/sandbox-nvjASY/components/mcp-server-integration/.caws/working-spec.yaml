threats:
  - threat: MCP protocol violations break external integrations
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Protocol compliance tests, validation suite, integration tests
  - threat: Unauthorized access to arbiter tools via MCP
    likelihood: medium
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Authentication tests, authorization validation, security audit
  - threat: MCP server performance bottleneck
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Load testing, async processing, connection pooling

invariants:
  - MCP protocol compliance is maintained
  - All arbiter tools are exposed correctly
  - Authentication is required for all operations
  - Tool invocations are idempotent where possible
  - Error responses follow MCP spec
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: MCP server integration with comprehensive test suite
    when: All tests are executed
    then: 90%+ branch coverage achieved, protocol compliance validated
  - id: A2
    given: MCP server exposing all arbiter tools
    when: Tool discovery is performed
    then: All tools listed correctly, metadata accurate, capabilities documented
  - id: A3
    given: MCP client invoking tool operations
    when: Tool calls are executed
    then: Operations succeed, responses follow MCP spec, error handling correct
  - id: A4
    given: MCP server with authentication enabled
    when: Unauthorized access attempted
    then: Authentication required, unauthorized requests rejected, security events logged
  - id: A5
    given: MCP server under concurrent load
    when: 100+ concurrent tool invocations occur
    then: All requests handled, no blocking, connection pooling active, P95 <200ms
  - id: A6
    given: MCP server with error conditions
    when: Tool invocations encounter errors
    then: Errors handled gracefully, MCP error format followed, recovery possible
  - id: A7
    given: MCP protocol version changes
    when: Protocol updates are released
    then: Backward compatibility maintained, version negotiation works, clients unaffected
  - id: A8
    given: MCP server integration with external clients
    when: Real MCP clients connect
    then: Integration successful, all tools accessible, no protocol violations

invariants:
  - "Workspace state must be consistent across agent sessions"
  - "File watching must not consume excessive CPU/memory resources"
  - "State snapshots must be incremental and compressed"
  - "Workspace context must be limited to relevant files only"
acceptance:
  - id: "WS-001"
    given: "A workspace with multiple files and directories"
    when: "Workspace State Manager is initialized"
    then: "It creates an initial snapshot of all relevant files"
  - id: "WS-002"
    given: "A file is modified in the workspace"
    when: "The file watcher detects the change"
    then: "Workspace state is updated with the modification"
  - id: "WS-003"
    given: "An agent requests workspace context"
    when: "Context manager selects relevant files"
    then: "Only files relevant to the agent's task are returned"
  - id: "WS-004"
    given: "Workspace state exists from previous session"
    when: "System restarts"
    then: "Workspace state is restored from persistent storage"
  - id: "WS-005"
    given: "Multiple agents modify different files"
    when: "Changes are detected"
    then: "State updates are handled without conflicts"
  - id: "WS-006"
    given: "Workspace contains large binary files"
    when: "State snapshot is created"
    then: "Binary files are excluded from content tracking"

  security:

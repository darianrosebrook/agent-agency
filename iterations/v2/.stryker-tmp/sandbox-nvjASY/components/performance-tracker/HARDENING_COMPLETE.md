## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **In-Memory Storage Only**

   - Data is not persisted to disk/database
   - System restart loses all collected data
   - **Mitigation**: Export training data regularly for persistence

2. **Synchronous Cleanup**

   - Cleanup happens synchronously on each event
   - Could cause brief latency spikes under extreme load
   - **Mitigation**: Cleanup is fast (< 1ms) and infrequent

3. **No Built-in Visualization**
   - Component provides raw data exports
   - No dashboard or visualization built-in
   - **Mitigation**: Use external tools for visualization

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- **Persistent Storage**: Database integration for long-term storage
- **Real-Time Streaming**: WebSocket/SSE for live metric streaming
- **Advanced Analytics**: Built-in trend analysis and forecasting
- **Alerting System**: Automated alerts for anomalies
- **Dashboard Integration**: Web UI for real-time visualization

### Deployment Configuration

**Recommended Production Settings**:

```typescript
const tracker = new PerformanceTracker({
  enabled: true,
  maxEventsInMemory: 100000, // Adjust based on available memory
  retentionPeriodMs: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days

  anonymizeData: true, // Enable for privacy compliance
});
```

**Monitoring Metrics**:

- Events per second
- Memory usage
- Export latency
- Data retention effectiveness
- Anomaly detection rate

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise post-deployment:

1. **Immediate**: Disable collection via `tracker.updateConfig({ enabled: false })`
2. **Data preservation**: Export all collected data before rollback
3. **Rollback**: Revert to previous PerformanceTracker version
4. **Investigation**: Analyze exported data to identify root cause
5. **Fix and redeploy**: Address issues and redeploy with additional tests

**Rollback SLO**: < 5 minutes (met by instant config update)

---

## Maintenance & Operations

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Track collection rate**: Events per second over time
2. **Monitor memory usage**: Ensure within configured limits
3. **Track export frequency**: Regular exports for data persistence
4. **Alert on anomalies**: Unusual patterns in performance metrics
5. **Log errors**: Any DataCollector integration failures

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- **Weekly**: Review performance trends and anomalies
- **Monthly**: Analyze data retention effectiveness
- **Quarterly**: Review and adjust configuration based on usage patterns
- **Annually**: Evaluate need for persistent storage migration

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue**: Memory usage growing unbounded

- **Check**: `maxEventsInMemory` configuration
- **Action**: Reduce limit or increase export frequency

**Issue**: Missing metrics in exported data

- **Check**: `enabled` configuration and `isActive()` status
- **Action**: Ensure collection is started before operations

**Issue**: Performance degradation

- **Check**: Event count and retention period
- **Action**: Reduce retention period or increase batch size

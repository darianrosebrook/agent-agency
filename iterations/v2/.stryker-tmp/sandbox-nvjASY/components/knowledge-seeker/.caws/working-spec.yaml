threats:
  - threat: Search provider failures block knowledge acquisition
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Multiple search providers, fallback strategies, circuit breakers
  - threat: Information processing errors corrupt results
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Validation tests, error handling, result verification
  - threat: Search rate limits cause service degradation
    likelihood: medium
    impact: low
    mitigation: Rate limiting tests, backoff strategies, caching

invariants:
  - Search results are always validated before return
  - Multiple search providers provide redundancy
  - Rate limits are respected for all providers
  - Information processing is deterministic
  - Results are cached to minimize external calls
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Knowledge seeker with comprehensive test suite
    when: All tests are executed
    then: 80%+ branch coverage achieved, all integration tests passing
  - id: A2
    given: Knowledge seeker with multiple search providers
    when: Primary provider fails
    then: Fallback to secondary provider, no service interruption, results delivered
  - id: A3
    given: Knowledge seeker processing search results
    when: Information extraction is performed
    then: Results validated, formatting correct, metadata preserved, no data corruption
  - id: A4
    given: Knowledge seeker under rate limiting
    when: Rate limits are exceeded
    then: Backoff strategy engaged, requests queued, no failures, eventual completion
  - id: A5
    given: Knowledge seeker with cached results
    when: Identical query repeated
    then: Cached results returned, no external API calls, P95 <50ms
  - id: A6
    given: Knowledge seeker integration with task execution
    when: Research tasks are requested
    then: Accurate information retrieved, sources cited, confidence scores provided
  - id: A7
    given: Knowledge seeker error conditions
    when: Provider errors or timeouts occur
    then: Graceful degradation, partial results returned, errors logged
  - id: A8
    given: Knowledge seeker performance testing
    when: Concurrent searches are performed
    then: Parallel processing active, no blocking, P95 <500ms per search

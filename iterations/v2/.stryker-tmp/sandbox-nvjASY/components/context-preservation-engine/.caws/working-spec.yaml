threats:
  - threat: Context compression loses critical information
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Compression validation tests, information retention metrics, recovery tests
  - threat: Memory leaks from context accumulation
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Memory leak tests, cleanup validation, resource monitoring
  - threat: Context retrieval performance degrades with size
    likelihood: high
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Performance optimization, indexing strategies, caching

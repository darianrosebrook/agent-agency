threats:
  - threat: Information quality degradation from biased sources
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Implement source credibility scoring and cross-validation
  - threat: Search result manipulation or gaming
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Use multiple search providers and result diversity checks
  - threat: Excessive API usage leading to rate limiting
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Implement intelligent caching and usage throttling

invariants:
  - Knowledge queries never block critical arbiter operations
  - All external API calls include proper error handling and retries
  - Information sources are logged for auditability and bias detection
  - Search results are processed asynchronously to avoid blocking
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: A knowledge query requiring external research
    when: Knowledge Seeker receives the query
    then: Query is processed and relevant information is retrieved within performance bounds
  - id: A2
    given: Multiple search providers are available
    when: Knowledge Seeker performs a search
    then: Results from multiple providers are aggregated and ranked by relevance
  - id: A3
    given: Search results contain varying quality information
    when: Knowledge Seeker processes results
    then: Results are filtered for relevance and credibility before returning
  - id: A4
    given: Knowledge Seeker is under high load
    when: Multiple concurrent queries are processed
    then: System maintains performance through intelligent caching and queuing
  - id: A5
    given: External search services become unavailable
    when: Knowledge Seeker attempts to search
    then: System degrades gracefully with cached results or error indication

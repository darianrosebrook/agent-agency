rollback_plan: |
  1. Disable adaptive resource manager via feature flag
  2. Fall back to static resource allocation
  3. Stop dynamic load balancing
  4. System continues with default resource policies
  5. No data loss - resource allocation is stateless

estimated_effort:
  planning: "1 day"
  implementation: "8-12 days"
  testing: "5-8 days"
  total: "14-21 days"

notes: |
  This is a Tier 3 (low risk) component that enhances resource utilization
  and load distribution. It is not required for core system functionality.
  
  The manager focuses on:
  - Dynamic load balancing across agents
  - Resource-aware task allocation
  - Priority-based resource allocation
  - Automatic failover handling
  - Graceful degradation to static allocation
  
  Implementation follows incremental approach:
  1. Basic resource monitoring
  2. Simple load balancing
  3. Priority-based allocation
  4. Dynamic rate limiting
  5. Failover management
  6. Capacity planning analysis
  
  Integration points:
  - SystemHealthMonitor for resource metrics
  - AgentRegistryManager for agent pool
  - TaskRouter for task distribution
  - ArbiterOrchestrator for system coordination

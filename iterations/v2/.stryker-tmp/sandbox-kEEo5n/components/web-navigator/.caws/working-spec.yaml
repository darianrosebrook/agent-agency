threats:
  - threat: Web scraping errors corrupt extracted content
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Content validation tests, error handling, retry logic
  - threat: Search engine rate limits block navigation
    likelihood: high
    impact: low
    mitigation: Rate limiting tests, backoff strategies, caching
  - threat: Malicious content injection during extraction
    likelihood: low
    impact: high
    mitigation: Content sanitization tests, security validation, XSS prevention

invariants:
  - All extracted content is sanitized
  - Search engine rate limits are respected
  - Content extraction is reproducible
  - Failed navigations do not crash system
  - Navigation history is maintained
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Web navigator with comprehensive test suite
    when: All tests are executed
    then: 80%+ branch coverage achieved, content extraction validated
  - id: A2
    given: Web navigator extracting web content
    when: Content extraction is performed
    then: Content extracted accurately, sanitized, metadata preserved
  - id: A3
    given: Web navigator with rate limiting
    when: Rate limits are encountered
    then: Backoff strategy engaged, requests queued, eventual success
  - id: A4
    given: Web navigator with multiple search engines
    when: Primary engine fails
    then: Fallback to secondary engine, no service interruption
  - id: A5
    given: Web navigator with content validation
    when: Malicious content encountered
    then: Content sanitized, threats removed, security maintained
  - id: A6
    given: Web navigator integration with knowledge seeker
    when: End-to-end web research performed
    then: Content extracted, processed, results delivered
  - id: A7
    given: Web navigator error conditions
    when: Navigation failures occur
    then: Graceful error handling, partial results returned, errors logged
  - id: A8
    given: Web navigator performance testing
    when: Concurrent navigations performed
    then: Parallel processing active, no blocking, P95 <2000ms

title: "CAWS Validator - Constitutional Authority and Quality Gate Enforcement"
version: "2.0.0"
mode: feature
risk_tier: 1
status: spec_complete

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The CAWS Validator serves as the constitutional authority for all agentic behavior within Agent Agency V2. It enforces CAWS (Coding-Agent Working Standard) rules, validates working specifications, enforces quality gates, and ensures all agent actions remain within constitutional bounds.
  scope:
    - Constitutional compliance validation for all agent outputs
    - Budget enforcement (files, lines of code, complexity)
    - Quality gate verification (tests, coverage, security)
    - Waiver interpretation and time-bounded approvals
    - Real-time constitutional arbitration
  success_criteria:
    - All verdicts issued within 200ms P95 latency
    - Zero false positives in constitutional violations
    - 100% accuracy in budget and quality gate enforcement
    - Support constitutional arbitration at 500 decisions/second

threats:
  - "False positives blocking legitimate agent work"

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Constitutional validation requires precise rule interpretation and consistent enforcement. While AI can help implement the validation logic, the constitutional rules themselves must be human-authored and AI-validated to prevent recursive validation issues."

  risks:
    - "Complex constitutional logic may contain subtle interpretation bugs"
    - "Performance requirements demand highly optimized validation algorithms"
    - "Waiver system could be exploited if not properly secured"

  opportunities:
    - "Clear pass/fail criteria make validation logic testable"
    - "TypeScript's type safety helps prevent constitutional logic errors"
    - "Automated testing can achieve high confidence in correctness"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement constitutional rules as declarative data structures"
    - "Use comprehensive property-based testing for edge cases"
    - "Include extensive audit logging for all constitutional decisions"
    - "Allow rule updates only through human-approved change management"

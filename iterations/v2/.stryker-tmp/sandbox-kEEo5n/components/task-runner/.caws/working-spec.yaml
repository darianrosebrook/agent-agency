threats:
  - threat: Task execution failures corrupt worker state
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Worker isolation tests, state recovery tests, error handling validation
  - threat: Concurrent task execution causes race conditions
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Concurrency tests, isolation validation, lock testing
  - threat: Pleading workflow errors block task completion
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Workflow validation tests, error recovery tests, timeout handling

invariants:
  - Task execution is isolated per worker
  - Worker failures do not affect other workers
  - Task state is persistent and recoverable
  - Pleading workflows are auditable
  - Concurrent tasks do not interfere
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Task runner with comprehensive test suite
    when: All tests are executed
    then: 80%+ branch coverage achieved, all orchestration tests passing
  - id: A2
    given: Task runner executing tasks in workers
    when: Tasks are submitted
    then: Workers execute tasks, isolation maintained, state preserved
  - id: A3
    given: Task runner with concurrent tasks
    when: Multiple tasks execute simultaneously
    then: No race conditions, proper isolation, correct results
  - id: A4
    given: Task runner with worker failures
    when: Worker crashes during execution
    then: Other workers unaffected, task recovery possible, state preserved
  - id: A5
    given: Task runner with pleading workflows
    when: Pleading is required
    then: Workflow executed correctly, decisions tracked, audit trail complete
  - id: A6
    given: Task runner integration with orchestrator
    when: End-to-end task execution performed
    then: Tasks routed, executed, results returned, metrics collected
  - id: A7
    given: Task runner error conditions
    when: Task execution errors occur
    then: Graceful error handling, recovery strategies applied, alerts triggered
  - id: A8
    given: Task runner performance testing
    when: High task load applied
    then: Worker pool scales, throughput maintained, latency within limits

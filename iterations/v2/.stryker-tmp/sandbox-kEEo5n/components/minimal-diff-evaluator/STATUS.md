## Acceptance Criteria Status

### RL-002-A1: Minimal Changes (< 10 lines)

**Status**: ✅ PASS  
**Evidence**: Tests verify high minimality factor (≥ 0.9) for minimal changes

### RL-002-A2: Excessive Scaffolding (> 100 lines boilerplate)

**Status**: ✅ PASS  
**Evidence**: Tests verify low minimality factor (≤ 0.3) with scaffolding penalty applied

### RL-002-A3: High AST Similarity (> 90%)

**Status**: ✅ PASS  
**Evidence**: Tests verify similarity score ≥ 0.9 for small changes

### RL-002-A4: Large Diff Performance (5000+ lines)

**Status**: ✅ PASS  
**Evidence**: Tests verify analysis completes within 200ms P95 budget

### RL-002-A5: Reward Multiplication

**Status**: ✅ PASS  
**Evidence**: Tests verify minimality factor scales rewards appropriately

## Files Implemented

### Core Implementation

- `src/types/evaluation.ts` - Type definitions and interfaces
- `src/evaluation/ASTDiffAnalyzer.ts` - AST parsing and diff analysis
- `src/evaluation/ScaffoldingDetector.ts` - Scaffolding pattern detection
- `src/evaluation/MinimalDiffEvaluator.ts` - Main evaluator coordinating components
- `src/evaluation/index.ts` - Public API exports

### Test Files

- `tests/unit/evaluation/ASTDiffAnalyzer.test.ts` (13 tests)
- `tests/unit/evaluation/ScaffoldingDetector.test.ts` (10 tests)
- `tests/unit/evaluation/MinimalDiffEvaluator.test.ts` (17 tests)

## Key Features

### AST Diff Analysis

- TypeScript/JavaScript support via TypeScript compiler
- Generic line-based fallback for other languages
- Node-level change tracking (added/removed/modified)
- Jaccard similarity index calculation
- Handles malformed code gracefully

### Scaffolding Detection

- Pattern-based detection (comments, imports, whitespace, redundant code)
- Category-specific thresholds
- Confidence scoring for detections
- Customizable penalty weights
- Extensible pattern system

### Minimality Evaluation

- Weighted scoring (70% similarity, 30% lines changed)
- Scaffolding penalty application
- Bounded factor (0.1-1.0)
- Quality assessment categorization
- Configurable scoring parameters

### Monitoring

- Evaluation timing tracking
- AST similarity reporting
- Scaffolding detection metrics
- Lines changed reporting

## Integration Points

The MinimalDiffEvaluator is ready to integrate with:

- **TurnLevelRLTrainer**: Provides minimality factors for reward shaping
- **PerformanceTracker**: Reports evaluation metrics
- **BenchmarkDataCollector**: Analyzes code diffs for training data

## Known Limitations

- **Language Support**: Full AST support only for TypeScript/JavaScript; other languages use generic line-based parser
- **Scaffolding Patterns**: Current patterns optimized for TypeScript; may need tuning for other languages
- **Performance**: Large diffs (> 10,000 LOC) may approach but not exceed performance budgets

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] All tests passing (40/40)
- [x] Test coverage ≥80% branch coverage (actual: 80.0%)
- [x] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Performance budgets met (analysis <200ms)
- [x] Security controls implemented
- [x] Input validation in place
- [x] Error handling comprehensive
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Working spec validated

## Next Steps

1. Integration with TurnLevelRLTrainer for RL reward calculation
2. Add language-specific scaffolding patterns (Python, Go, etc.)
3. Performance monitoring in production
4. Consider mutation testing once TypeScript errors are resolved project-wide

threats:
  - threat: Benchmark execution errors corrupt performance data
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Comprehensive validation tests, error handling, data integrity checks
  - threat: Benchmarking overhead impacts production performance
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Async benchmarking, resource limits, scheduling controls
  - threat: Regression detection false positives cause unnecessary rollbacks
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, threshold tuning

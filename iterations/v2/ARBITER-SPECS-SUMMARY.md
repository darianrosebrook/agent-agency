## Data Migration Strategy

### Migration Order

Components with database migrations should be deployed in this order:

1. **ARBITER-001**: Agent Registry tables (migration_001)
2. **ARBITER-003**: Provenance tables (migration_002)
3. **ARBITER-004**: Benchmark tables with TimescaleDB (migration_003)
4. **ARBITER-005**: Orchestrator state tables (migration_004)

All migrations are designed for **zero-downtime deployment** with rollback capability.

## Quality Assurance Requirements

### Test Coverage by Component

| Component            | Unit Coverage | Integration Tests     | E2E Tests               |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Agent Registry       | ≥80%          | Registry operations   | Full agent lifecycle    |
| Task Routing         | ≥80%          | Routing accuracy      | End-to-end task flow    |
| CAWS Validator       | ≥90%          | Enforcement pipeline  | CAWS compliance         |
| Performance Tracker  | ≥80%          | Data collection       | Data quality validation |
| Arbiter Orchestrator | ≥85%          | Component integration | Complete workflow       |

### Performance Testing

All components must meet P95 latency targets under concurrent load:

- Run load tests with 100 concurrent tasks
- Validate latency budgets hold under sustained load
- Measure throughput and identify bottlenecks

---

## Security Considerations

### Tier 1 Components (Critical)

**ARBITER-003 (CAWS Validator)** and **ARBITER-005 (Arbiter Orchestrator)** are Tier 1:

- Require manual code review before deployment
- Must maintain 100% CAWS compliance
- Provenance chain integrity is critical
- Waiver approval process must be secure

### Tier 2 Components (Standard)

**ARBITER-001**, **ARBITER-002**, **ARBITER-004** are Tier 2:

- Automated deployment allowed after quality gates pass
- Must prevent data leakage (registry, routing decisions, telemetry)
- Agent identity verification required
- Privacy scanning mandatory for all collected data

---

## Observability Strategy

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**System Health**:

- `orchestrator_availability_sla`: Target 99.9%
- `health_check_success_rate`: Target 99%
- `task_completion_rate`: Track success/failure ratio

**Performance**:

- `routing_decision_latency_p95`: Target <200ms
- `validation_execution_latency_p95`: Target <500ms
- `data_collection_overhead_p95`: Target <50ms

**Quality**:

- `caws_compliance_rate`: Target 100%
- `routing_accuracy_rate`: Target ≥85%
- `data_validation_pass_rate`: Target ≥95%

### Distributed Tracing

Implement end-to-end traces for:

- Task lifecycle (submission → routing → execution → validation → completion)
- CAWS enforcement flow
- Performance data collection pipeline
- Health monitoring and recovery workflows

## Next Steps

### For Implementation Teams

1. **Review specs**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are clear
2. **Validate contracts**: Review TypeScript interfaces and OpenAPI specs
3. **Set up migrations**: Prepare database schemas in dependency order
4. **Create test plans**: Map acceptance criteria to test cases
5. **Define performance benchmarks**: Set up load testing infrastructure

### For Architecture Review

1. Validate component boundaries and interfaces
2. Review risk tiers and mitigation strategies
3. Confirm performance budgets are achievable
4. Assess integration complexity and dependencies

### For CAWS Validation

Each spec has been validated with `caws validate` and passes all checks. Before implementation:

```bash
# Validate individual component specs
cd agent-registry-manager && caws validate
cd task-routing-manager && caws validate
cd caws-validator && caws validate
cd performance-tracker && caws validate
cd arbiter-orchestrator && caws validate
```

# CAWS Budget Exceeded Response Playbook

## Overview

This playbook outlines the response procedures for handling CAWS budget violations including file count limits, lines of code limits, and resource utilization thresholds.

## Budget Violation Types

### File Count Violations

- **Threshold**: Maximum files per task (default: 25)
- **Severity**: Based on exceedance percentage
- **Impact**: Task execution blocked, agent flagged

### Lines of Code Violations

- **Threshold**: Maximum LOC per task (default: 1000)
- **Severity**: Based on exceedance percentage and task complexity
- **Impact**: Task execution blocked, code review required

### Resource Utilization Violations

- **Memory**: Excessive memory usage during execution
- **CPU**: CPU time limits exceeded
- **Network**: Bandwidth or connection limits exceeded
- **Storage**: Disk space or I/O limits exceeded

## Severity Classification

### Critical (Immediate Response)

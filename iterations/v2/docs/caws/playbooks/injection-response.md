# CAWS Injection Response Playbook

## Overview

This playbook outlines the response procedures for detecting and mitigating prompt injection, SQL injection, command injection, and other malicious input patterns in the task intake system.

## Severity Levels

### Critical (Immediate Response Required)

- SQL injection with destructive commands (DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE)
- Command injection with system-level commands (rm -rf, shutdown, format)
- Path traversal attempts to access system files (/etc/passwd, /windows/system32)

### High (Response within 15 minutes)

- Prompt injection attempts (ignore instructions, jailbreak techniques)
- SQL injection with data extraction attempts
- Command injection with network commands (curl, wget, nc)

### Medium (Response within 1 hour)

- XSS injection attempts
- Path traversal with directory navigation
- Prompt injection with role manipulation

### Low (Response within 4 hours)

- Suspicious character patterns
- Minor injection attempts
- Potential false positives

## Response Procedures

### 1. Immediate Actions (All Severities)

#### Detection Phase

1. **Alert Generation**

   - System automatically logs injection attempt with full context
   - Alert sent to security team and operations team
   - Task submission blocked immediately

2. **Content Analysis**

   - Extract and preserve original malicious content
   - Analyze injection pattern and attack vector
   - Determine if this is part of a coordinated attack

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Check if any similar patterns detected recently
   - Assess potential system compromise
   - Review affected agent's recent activity

#### Containment Phase

1. **Task Blocking**

   - Reject task submission with appropriate error message
   - Block originating agent if pattern suggests systematic abuse
   - Implement temporary rate limiting if needed

2. **Agent Review**
   - Review agent's task history for similar patterns
   - Check agent's performance metrics and compliance record
   - Consider temporary suspension for repeated violations

### 2. Critical Severity Response

#### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)

1. **Emergency Blocking**

   ```bash
   # Block agent immediately
   curl -X POST /api/agents/{agentId}/suspend \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"reason": "critical_injection_detected", "duration": "24h"}'
   ```

2. **System Hardening**

   - Increase input validation strictness
   - Enable additional security filters
   - Review and update injection detection patterns

3. **Incident Commander Assignment**
   - Assign senior security engineer as incident commander
   - Establish communication channels (Slack, phone)
   - Notify management and legal if required

#### Investigation (5-30 minutes)

1. **Forensic Analysis**

   - Capture full request payload and headers
   - Analyze attack sophistication and intent
   - Check for lateral movement or persistence

2. **Threat Intelligence**

   - Search for known attack signatures
   - Check if this matches known threat actor patterns
   - Review recent security advisories

3. **System Impact Assessment**
   - Verify no successful system compromise
   - Check logs for similar attempts from other sources
   - Assess data exposure risk

#### Recovery (30-60 minutes)

1. **Pattern Updates**

   ```yaml
   # Update injection detection patterns
   - Add new pattern to PromptInjectionDetector
   - Test pattern effectiveness
   - Deploy updated detection rules
   ```

2. **Agent Rehabilitation**

   - Review agent's training records
   - Assign mandatory security training
   - Implement enhanced monitoring

3. **System Monitoring**
   - Increase monitoring sensitivity
   - Set up alerts for similar patterns
   - Review system logs for anomalies

### 3. High Severity Response

#### Response Actions (0-15 minutes)

1. **Task Rejection**

   - Block specific task with detailed error message
   - Log incident with full context
   - Notify security team

2. **Agent Investigation**
   - Review agent's recent task submissions
   - Check for pattern of suspicious behavior
   - Assess need for additional training

#### Follow-up Actions (15-60 minutes)

1. **Pattern Analysis**

   - Analyze injection technique used
   - Update detection rules if needed
   - Document lessons learned

2. **Training Assignment**
   - Assign relevant security training module
   - Schedule follow-up assessment
   - Monitor future task submissions

### 4. Medium Severity Response

#### Response Actions (0-60 minutes)

1. **Content Sanitization**

   - Automatically sanitize malicious content
   - Log sanitization actions
   - Proceed with task if safe

2. **Agent Notification**
   - Send warning message to agent
   - Provide guidance on proper input formatting
   - Document incident for future reference

#### Follow-up Actions (1-4 hours)

1. **Pattern Review**

   - Review detection accuracy
   - Adjust false positive rates if needed
   - Update training materials

2. **Preventive Measures**
   - Enhance input validation
   - Improve user guidance
   - Update documentation

### 5. Low Severity Response

#### Response Actions (0-4 hours)

1. **Pattern Logging**

   - Log suspicious pattern for analysis
   - No immediate action required
   - Monitor for escalation

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Review pattern frequency
   - Assess if escalation needed
   - Update detection thresholds

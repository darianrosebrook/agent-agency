## Assessment Methodology

Each component was assessed against three sources of truth:

1. **Working Spec** (`.caws/working-spec.yaml`)

   - Acceptance criteria (A1-A6)
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Performance targets
   - Security requirements

2. **Theory Document** (`docs/1-core-orchestration/theory.md`)

   - Constitutional authority patterns
   - Multi-armed bandit algorithms
   - Hardware-aware optimizations
   - Provenance tracking
   - Adversarial arbitration

3. **Actual Implementation**
   - Code structure and completeness
   - Test coverage
   - Database integration
   - Security implementation
   - TypeScript compilation status

## Previous False Claims

The following documents were found to contain inaccurate completion percentages and have been analyzed:

- ‚ùå "ARBITER-001 90-92% complete" ‚Üí Actually 35%
- ‚ùå "20/20 tests passing" ‚Üí Actually 0/20 (can't run)
- ‚ùå "Production-ready" ‚Üí Actually in development

These documents were reportedly deleted per `V2-SPECS-ACTUAL-STATUS.md` on October 11, 2025.

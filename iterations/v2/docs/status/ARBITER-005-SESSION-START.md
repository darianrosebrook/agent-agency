# ARBITER-005 Implementation Session Started

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Session Type**: Implementation Start  
**Status**: Phase 0 - Foundation Hardening Initiated

---

## Session Summary

User requested to begin working on ARBITER-005. Following the implementation plan, I started with **Phase 0: Foundation Hardening** to ensure ARBITER-001 through 004 are solid before building orchestration.

### What I Attempted

**Phase 0.1: Integration Tests**

- Created initial integration test suite for components 001-004
- Encountered significant type mismatches between test expectations and actual implementations
- Discovered current type definitions don't align perfectly with actual component interfaces

### Key Findings

**Type System Issues**:

1. `RoutingDecision` has two different definitions (`arbiter-orchestration.ts` vs `agentic-rl.ts`)
2. `Task` interface is very complex with many required fields
3. `WorkingSpec` requires many fields beyond basic spec
4. `AgentQueryResult` uses `agent` property, not `profile`
5. `AgentQuery` uses `taskType` (singular), not `taskTypes` (plural)
6. `routing.selectedAgent` returns `AgentProfile` object, not string ID

**Component Interface Reality**:

- `AgentRegistryManager`: Has `getProfile()`, not `getAgent()`
- `TaskRoutingManager`: Constructor requires `AgentRegistryManager` directly
- `PerformanceTracker`: No `initialize()`, `cleanup()`, or `getMetrics()` methods
- Components don't have standardized lifecycle methods

### Decision Point

We have two paths forward:

**Option A: Fix Type System First** (Recommended)

- Resolve type definition conflicts
- Create helper functions for test data creation
- Ensure types match actual implementations
- **Time**: 1-2 days
- **Benefit**: Clean foundation for all future work

**Option B: Skip Integration Tests, Move to Implementation**

- Start Phase 1 (Core Orchestration) immediately
- Fix types as we go
- Add integration tests later
- **Time**: Faster start, but risky
- **Risk**: Building on shaky foundation

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)

**1. Type System Audit & Cleanup** (4-6 hours)

Create `/Users/darianrosebrook/Desktop/Projects/agent-agency/iterations/v2/src/types/README.md`:

````markdown
# Type System Organization

## Core Types by Component

- `agent-registry.ts`: Agent profiles, queries, capabilities
- `arbiter-orchestration.ts`: Tasks, routing, orchestration
- `agentic-rl.ts`: RL-specific types
- `caws-types.ts`: CAWS working specs
- `performance-tracking.ts`: Performance metrics

## Type Conflicts to Resolve

1. **RoutingDecision**: Two definitions exist

   - `arbiter-orchestration.ts`: Includes `routingStrategy`, `alternativesConsidered`, `rationale`
   - `agentic-rl.ts`: Different structure
   - **Resolution**: Choose one as canonical, deprecate other

2. **Task**: Very complex interface
   - **Resolution**: Create `TaskRequest` helper type for easier construction
   - Create test fixtures for common task types

## Test Helpers Needed

```typescript
// File: tests/helpers/test-fixtures.ts

export function createMinimalTask(overrides?: Partial<Task>): Task {
  return {
    id: `test-${Date.now()}`,
    description: "Test task",
    type: "code-editing",
    requiredCapabilities: {},
    priority: 5,
    timeoutMs: 30000,
    budget: { maxFiles: 10, maxLoc: 500 },
    createdAt: new Date(),
    metadata: {},
    attempts: 0,
    maxAttempts: 3,
    ...overrides,
  };
}

export function createMinimalWorkingSpec(
  overrides?: Partial<WorkingSpec>
): WorkingSpec {
  return {
    id: `TEST-${Date.now()}`,
    title: "Test spec",
    mode: "feature",
    risk_tier: 3,
    change_budget: { max_files: 10, max_loc: 500 },
    blast_radius: { modules: [], data_migration: false },
    operational_rollback_slo: "5m",
    scope: { in: ["src/"], out: ["node_modules/"] },
    invariants: [],
    acceptance: [
      { id: "A1", given: "condition", when: "action", then: "result" },
    ],
    non_functional: {},
    contracts: [],
    ...overrides,
  };
}
```
````

```

**2. Create Type Definition Documentation** (2-3 hours)

For each major type, document:
- Where it's defined
- What components use it
- Example construction
- Common patterns

**3. Build Test Fixture Library** (3-4 hours)

Create reusable test fixtures in `tests/helpers/` for:
- Agents
- Tasks
- Routing decisions
- Working specs
- Performance metrics

---

## Alternative Approach: Skip Phase 0, Go Directly to Phase 1

If you want to move faster, we can:

1. **Skip integration tests for now**
2. **Start implementing ARBITER-005 core components**:
   - Task State Machine
   - Task Orchestrator
   - Constitutional Runtime
3. **Fix types as we encounter issues**
4. **Add comprehensive tests after implementation**

**Trade-off**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Faster visible progress, momentum
- ❌ **Cons**: May need significant rework, harder debugging, unstable foundation

---

## What I Recommend

**Follow Option A: Fix Foundation First**

**Reasoning**:
1. ARBITER-005 is Risk Tier 1 (critical system)
2. Type conflicts will cause constant friction
3. Clean types = easier implementation
4. Better debugging experience
5. Foundation issues multiply in orchestration

**Timeline**:
- **Tomorrow (Day 1)**: Type system cleanup (4-6 hours)
- **Day 2**: Test fixtures and helpers (3-4 hours)
- **Day 3**: Simple integration tests (4-6 hours)
- **Day 4-5**: Begin Phase 1 implementation

**Total**: 2-3 days to solid foundation, then smooth sailing

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Do you want to fix types first, or proceed with implementation?**
   - Option A: Clean foundation (2-3 days, safer)
   - Option B: Start implementation now (faster, riskier)

2. **Are you comfortable with the timeline?**
   - Phase 0: 2-3 days
   - Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
   - Phase 2: 1-2 weeks
   - Phase 3: 1-2 weeks
   - Total: 6-10 weeks

3. **Any specific concerns about the approach?**

## TODO Status

Created 8 TODOs for ARBITER-005 implementation:

- [in_progress] Phase 0.1: Integration tests (blocked on type cleanup)
- [pending] Phase 0.2: Performance benchmarking
- [pending] Phase 0.3: Production infrastructure
- [pending] Phase 1.1: Task state machine
- [pending] Phase 1.2: Core orchestrator
- [pending] Phase 1.3: Constitutional runtime
- [pending] Phase 2.1: System coordinator
- [pending] Phase 2.2: Feedback loop manager

---

## Summary

We've done excellent planning and identified exactly what needs to be done. The implementation is ready to begin, but we've discovered that **the type system needs cleanup first** to avoid constant friction.

**Recommended**: Spend 2-3 days fixing types and creating test helpers, then proceed with orchestration implementation.

**Your Call**: Do you want to:
1. Fix types first (Option A - safer)
2. Start orchestration now (Option B - faster start, more rework)

**Status**: ⏸️ Paused at Phase 0.1, awaiting user direction

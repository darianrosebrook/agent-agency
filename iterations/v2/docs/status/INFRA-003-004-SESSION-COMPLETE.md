## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **CAWS Workflow**: Following the structured workflow (spec → types → implementation → tests) kept development focused and organized

2. **TDD Approach**: Writing tests alongside implementation caught edge cases early and improved code quality

3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types prevented many potential runtime errors

4. **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns made testing and iteration easier

5. **Documentation**: Inline JSDoc comments and working specs maintained clarity throughout

### Challenges

1. **Timer Tests**: Jest fake timer configuration proved tricky for async cleanup tests

2. **Severity Thresholds**: Balancing between sensitivity and noise in bottleneck detection required iteration

3. **Load Balancing Complexity**: Implementing 5 different strategies required careful design to avoid duplication

4. **Test Coverage**: Achieving high coverage while keeping tests maintainable required thoughtful test design

### Improvements for Next Time

1. **Early Performance Testing**: Could have benchmarked earlier to validate overhead assumptions

2. **Integration Tests First**: Could have written integration test scaffolds earlier to guide implementation

3. **Timer Handling**: Should have researched Jest timer mocking patterns before implementation

4. **Threshold Configuration**: Should have made thresholds more configurable from the start

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Cannot Claim Production-Ready Because

- ❌ Integration tests not written (required for Tier 3)
- ❌ Coverage not yet measured (need 70%+)
- ❌ Performance not benchmarked (<10ms, <50ms, <5% targets)
- ❌ Load testing not performed
- ❌ Long-running stability not validated

### What IS Ready

- ✅ Core implementation functional
- ✅ 93.7% of unit tests passing
- ✅ Zero linting/type errors
- ✅ CAWS specifications validated
- ✅ Graceful degradation implemented
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ✅ Logging and observability integrated
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code

### Current Status

**INFRA-003**: 🟡 **In Development** (96% functional, needs integration testing)  
**INFRA-004**: 🟢 **Functional** (100% functional, needs integration testing)

Both components are suitable for development use and can be safely merged to enable further system integration work.

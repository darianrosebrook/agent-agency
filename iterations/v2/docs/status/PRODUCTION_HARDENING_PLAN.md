# Production Hardening Plan - Agent Agency V2

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Author**: @darianrosebrook  
**Status**: In Development

---

## Executive Summary

This plan details the production hardening work for 12 functional components that have substantial implementations but need comprehensive testing, documentation, and production-grade reliability.

**Scope**: 12 components, ~9,500 lines of existing code  
**Effort**: 12-16 weeks with 2 developers (6-8 weeks parallel)  
**Goal**: Elevate functional components to production-ready status (80-90% coverage, comprehensive tests)

---

## Priority Matrix

Components prioritized by production criticality and dependency impact:

### Tier 1: Critical (Security, Monitoring, Integration)

Must be production-ready for any deployment:

| Component       | Priority | Reason                                        | Effort    | Blocking                   |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| **ARBITER-013** | P0       | Security Policy Enforcer - security critical  | 2 weeks   | All production deployments |
| **ARBITER-004** | P0       | Performance Tracker - observability critical  | 2 weeks   | Performance monitoring     |
| **INFRA-002**   | P0       | MCP Server Integration - external integration | 1.5 weeks | External tool access       |

**Total Tier 1**: 3 components, 5.5 weeks, **must complete first**

### Tier 2: High Value (Agent Capabilities)

Core agent functionality that enhances system capabilities:

| Component       | Priority | Reason                                        | Effort    | Blocking              |

**Total Tier 2**: 4 components, 7.5 weeks

### Tier 3: Supporting (Infrastructure, Utilities)

Important but not blocking core functionality:

| Component       | Priority | Reason                                    | Effort    | Blocking           |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------ |

| **ARBITER-011** | P2       | System Health Monitor - health checks     | 2 weeks   | System monitoring  |

**Total Tier 3**: 5 components, 9 weeks

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Testing Debt Accumulation**

   - **Risk**: Existing code may have hidden bugs
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suites, mutation testing
   - **Contingency**: Extended testing phase if major issues found

2. **Integration Complexity**

   - **Risk**: Components may not integrate cleanly
   - **Mitigation**: Integration tests after each component
   - **Contingency**: Refactoring time budgeted

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Risk**: Tests may reveal performance issues
   - **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarks, optimization sprints
   - **Contingency**: Performance optimization phase

### Resource Risks

1. **Timeline Slippage**

   - **Risk**: Hardening may take longer than estimated
   - **Mitigation**: Buffer time in estimates, parallel tracks
   - **Contingency**: Defer Tier 3 components if needed

2. **Developer Availability**
   - **Risk**: Developers may not be available full-time
   - **Mitigation**: Clear task boundaries, can work independently
   - **Contingency**: Sequential execution if only 1 developer available

---

## Architectural Decisions

### State Machine Design

ARBITER-005 uses a clear state machine for task lifecycle:

```
RECEIVED → VALIDATING_SPEC → SPEC_APPROVED → ROUTING → ROUTED
         → EXECUTING → EXECUTION_COMPLETE → VERIFYING → VERIFIED → COMPLETED
                ↓           ↓               ↓           ↓           ↓
            REJECTED    FAILED          FAILED      FAILED      FAILED
```

**Rationale**: State machines are testable, debuggable, and reason-able

---

### Circuit Breakers Everywhere

Every component interaction protected by circuit breakers:

```typescript
const result = await circuitBreaker.execute(
  "caws_validator",
  () => this.cawsValidator.validateWorkingSpec(spec),
  { timeoutMs: 5000 }
);
```

**Rationale**: Prevent cascading failures in distributed system

---

### Distributed Tracing

End-to-end tracing across all components:

```typescript
return await this.tracing.traceWorkflow("orchestrate_task", async (span) => {
  // All operations traced with parent-child relationships
});
```

**Rationale**: Essential for debugging orchestration failures

---

### Constitutional Authority Runtime

Pre and post-execution constitutional checks:

```typescript
// Before execution
const preCheck = await this.constitutionalRuntime.validatePreExecution(request);

// After execution
const postCheck = await this.constitutionalRuntime.validatePostExecution(
  result,
  spec
);

// Generate verdict
const verdict = await this.constitutionalRuntime.generateVerdict(
  taskId,
  request,
  result,
  postCheck
);
```

**Rationale**: Ensure CAWS compliance at every step

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Foundation First

**Decision**: Complete Phase 0 before starting orchestration

**Rationale**:

- ARBITER-005 will expose any weakness in foundation
- Integration issues easier to fix now than later
- Better long-term velocity with solid foundation

### 2. Test-First Approach

**Decision**: Write integration tests before orchestration code

**Rationale**:

- Tests define the contract
- Easier to validate correctness
- Prevents implementation drift

### 3. Observability from Day One

**Decision**: Build tracing, logging, and monitoring into orchestration

**Rationale**:

- Debugging orchestration without observability is nearly impossible
- Adding observability later is expensive
- Essential for production operations

### 4. Circuit Breakers Everywhere

**Decision**: Protect all component interactions with circuit breakers

**Rationale**:

- Cascading failures are the #1 risk for orchestrators
- Fail fast and gracefully
- Automatic recovery

---

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Integration Complexity**

   - Risk: Components don't work together as expected
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive integration tests, circuit breakers
   - Contingency: Graceful degradation, manual failover

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**

   - Risk: Orchestration overhead exceeds budget
   - Mitigation: Early performance testing, profiling
   - Contingency: Horizontal scaling, caching

3. **State Inconsistency**

   - Risk: Distributed state gets out of sync
   - Mitigation: Transactional updates, distributed tracing
   - Contingency: State reconciliation, rollback procedures

4. **Constitutional Authority Bypass**
   - Risk: Orchestration gaps allow non-compliant work
   - Mitigation: Mandatory pre/post checks, verdict signing
   - Contingency: Audit trail analysis, automatic shutdown

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Weeks)

**Option A (Recommended): Foundation Hardening**

- Complete integration tests for 001-004
- Benchmark performance for 001, 002, 003
- Add observability infrastructure
- Memory profiling
- **Then** start ARBITER-005

**Pros**:

- Solid foundation reduces risk
- Better long-term velocity
- Fewer surprises during orchestration
- Easier debugging

**Cons**:

- Delays ARBITER-005 start by 1-2 weeks
- Less immediately visible progress

**Option B (Aggressive): Start ARBITER-005 Now**

- Begin orchestration implementation
- Fix integration issues as discovered
- Iterate quickly
- **Risk**: May need significant rework

**Pros**:

- Faster time to "complete" system
- Immediate visible progress
- Agile iteration

**Cons**:

- Foundation issues will multiply
- More rework likely
- Harder to debug
- Higher overall timeline risk

### My Strong Recommendation: Option A

**Reasoning**:

1. ARBITER-005 is Risk Tier 1 (critical)
2. It's the heart of the system - failure cascades everywhere
3. Foundation issues are easier to fix now
4. Better velocity long-term
5. More confidence in production readiness

---

## Timeline Comparison

### Option A: Foundation First

```
Week 1-2:   Foundation hardening (integration tests, benchmarks, observability)
Week 3-5:   Phase 1 - Core orchestration
Week 6-7:   Phase 2 - System coordination
Week 8-9:   Phase 3 - Testing & validation
Week 10:    Phase 4 - Production deployment

Total: 10 weeks to production-ready ARBITER-005
```

### Option B: Aggressive

```
Week 1-3:   Phase 1 - Core orchestration (while fixing foundation issues)
Week 4-5:   Phase 2 - System coordination (while fixing foundation issues)
Week 6-8:   Phase 3 - Testing (uncover integration issues, fix)
Week 9-10:  Rework and stabilization
Week 11:    Production deployment

Total: 11 weeks to production-ready ARBITER-005 (with higher risk)
```

**Conclusion**: Option A is likely faster to _actual_ production readiness despite appearing slower upfront.

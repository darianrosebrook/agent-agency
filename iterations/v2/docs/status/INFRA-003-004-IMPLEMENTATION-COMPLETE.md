2. Write integration tests with ArbiterOrchestrator
3. Performance benchmarking to verify overhead targets
4. Documentation updates in main README

### Medium Term (Production Hardening)

2. Memory leak testing (long-running scenarios)
3. Stress testing with high metric volumes
4. Real-world validation with production workloads

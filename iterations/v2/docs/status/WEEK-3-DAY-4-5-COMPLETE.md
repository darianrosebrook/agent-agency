## IterativeGuidance Features

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Acceptance Criteria Progress Analysis

**Implementation**:

- Analyzes each acceptance criterion individually
- Calculates progress percentage based on evidence found
- Determines status: `not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`
- Assesses confidence in progress evaluation
- Estimates remaining work hours

**Progress Calculation Logic**:

```typescript
// Evidence-based progress scoring
const evidenceScore = evidence.length * 20; // 0-80%
const completionBonus = hasTests && hasImpl ? 15 : 0; // +15% if both exist
const totalProgress = Math.min(95, evidenceScore + completionBonus);
```

#### 2. Intelligent Gap Identification

**Gap Categories**:

- **Testing**: Missing test coverage for acceptance criteria
- **Implementation**: Incomplete or missing functionality
- **Documentation**: Missing API contracts or specifications
- **Integration**: External system dependencies not met
- **Validation**: Budget or quality gate violations

**Gap Structure**:

```typescript
interface GapAnalysis {
  category:
    | "testing"
    | "implementation"
    | "documentation"
    | "integration"
    | "validation";
  description: string;
  severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
  affectedCriteria: string[];
  estimatedEffort: { hours: number; complexity: ComplexityLevel };
  remediationSteps: string[];
  priority: StepPriority;
}
```

#### 3. Actionable Next Steps Generation

**Step Prioritization**:

- **Critical**: Unblocks other work, prevents failures
- **High**: Core functionality implementation
- **Medium**: Quality improvements, refactoring
- **Low**: Nice-to-have optimizations

**Step Structure**:

```typescript
interface NextStep {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  priority: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low";
  category:
    | "implementation"
    | "testing"
    | "refactoring"
    | "documentation"
    | "integration";
  estimatedEffort: {
    hours: number;
    complexity: "simple" | "moderate" | "complex" | "expert";
    confidence: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  };
  prerequisites: string[];
  affectedFiles: string[];
  expectedOutcomes: string[];
  risk: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  dependencies: string[];
  parallelizable: boolean;
}
```

#### 4. Work Estimation with Confidence Intervals

**Estimation Factors**:

- **Complexity**: simple (1x), moderate (1.5x), complex (2.5x), expert (4x)
- **Team Experience**: junior (1.2x), senior (1.0x), expert (0.8x)
- **Time Pressure**: high/critical (+20-50%)
- **Parallelization**: Team size and parallelizable tasks

**Confidence Intervals**:

```typescript
confidenceIntervals: {
  pessimistic: totalHours * 1.5,    // +50% (worst case)
  optimistic: totalHours * 0.7,     // -30% (best case)
  mostLikely: totalHours,           // Baseline estimate
}
```

**Completion Date Estimation**:

- **6 hours/day** working assumption
- **5 days/week** working assumption
- Accounts for parallelization factor

#### 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Risk Factors Evaluated**:

- **Technical Debt**: Based on budget usage (>80% = risk)
- **Team Experience**: Junior teams have higher risk
- **Requirement Clarity**: Gaps indicate unclear requirements
- **External Dependencies**: API contracts and integrations
- **Time Pressure**: Critical deadlines increase risk

**Risk Levels**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`

#### 6. Step-by-Step Guidance

**Guidance Components**:

- **Current Step**: Detailed information about the current task
- **Progress Tracking**: Within-step progress (0-100%)
- **Tips**: Category-specific advice (implementation, testing, etc.)
- **Pitfalls**: Common mistakes to avoid
- **Quality Checks**: Completion verification criteria
- **Next Steps Preview**: Look-ahead at upcoming tasks

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Evidence-Based Progress Tracking

**Decision**: Use file-based evidence rather than complex parsing.

**Rationale**:

- Reliable and fast (no AST parsing required)
- Works with any codebase structure
- Easy to extend with new evidence types

**Benefits**:

- Fast analysis (sub-second for typical projects)
- Language-agnostic evidence detection
- Clear, auditable progress metrics

### 2. Multi-Factor Work Estimation

**Decision**: Complex estimation algorithm with multiple adjustment factors.

**Rationale**:

- Accounts for team dynamics, time pressure, complexity
- Provides realistic confidence intervals
- Adaptable to different project contexts

**Benefits**:

- More accurate than simple LOC-based estimates
- Helps with project planning and resource allocation
- Identifies risk factors proactively

### 3. Event-Driven Analysis Pipeline

**Decision**: Use EventEmitter pattern for analysis phases.

**Rationale**:

- Decouples analysis components
- Enables progress monitoring
- Allows external integration

**Benefits**:

- Real-time progress updates
- Easy to add monitoring/logging
- Clean separation of concerns

### 4. Context-Aware Guidance

**Decision**: Adjust guidance based on team size, experience, and project phase.

**Rationale**:

- Different teams need different guidance
- Project phase affects priorities
- Time pressure changes risk calculations

**Benefits**:

- Personalized, relevant guidance
- Appropriate for different team compositions
- Adaptable to project circumstances

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

### BudgetMonitor Integration

**Budget Usage Analysis**:

- Uses `BudgetUsage` data for gap identification
- Triggers budget-related warnings and recommendations
- Influences work estimates based on current utilization

### CAWS Integration

**Working Spec Analysis**:

- Parses acceptance criteria for progress tracking
- Respects scope boundaries (`scope.in`/`scope.out`)
- Uses risk tier for estimation adjustments

**Contract Validation**:

- Checks for API contract existence
- Validates external dependency availability
- Identifies integration gaps

### MCP Server Integration

**Future Enhancement**:

```typescript
// In arbiter_monitor_progress tool
const guidance = new IterativeGuidance(config);
const analysis = await guidance.analyzeProgress();

// Return guidance in MCP response
return {
  progress: analysis.summary?.overallProgress,
  nextSteps: analysis.summary?.nextSteps.slice(0, 3),
  criticalBlockers: analysis.summary?.criticalBlockers,
  workEstimate: analysis.summary?.workEstimate,
};
```

---

## Example Usage

### Basic Progress Analysis

```typescript
import { IterativeGuidance } from "./src/guidance";

const config = {
  spec: workingSpec,
  projectRoot: "/path/to/project",
  existingFiles: ["src/auth.ts", "src/user.ts"],
  testFiles: ["tests/auth.test.ts"],
  budgetUsage: currentBudgetUsage,
};

const guidance = new IterativeGuidance(config, {
  teamSize: 3,
  experienceLevel: "senior",
  timePressure: "medium",
});

const analysis = await guidance.analyzeProgress();

console.log(`Overall Progress: ${analysis.summary?.overallProgress}%`);
console.log(`Next Steps: ${analysis.summary?.nextSteps.length}`);
console.log(`Estimated Hours: ${analysis.summary?.workEstimate.totalHours}`);
```

### Step-by-Step Guidance

```typescript
const stepGuidance = await guidance.getStepGuidance(0);

console.log(`Step ${stepGuidance.currentStep}: ${stepGuidance.step.title}`);
console.log(`Time Remaining: ${stepGuidance.estimatedTimeRemaining}h`);
console.log(`Tips: ${stepGuidance.tips.join(", ")}`);
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Progress Heuristics

**Issue**: Determining "progress" from file evidence is inherently heuristic.

**Solution**: Multi-factor scoring with confidence assessment.

**Learning**: Progress tracking benefits from explicit confidence metrics rather than binary "complete/incomplete" states.

### Challenge 2: Work Estimation Accuracy

**Issue**: Software effort estimation is famously difficult.

**Rationale**: Use multiple adjustment factors with confidence intervals.

**Learning**: Better to provide ranges and explain assumptions than single-point estimates.

### Challenge 3: Context Sensitivity

**Issue**: Guidance needs to adapt to different team sizes, experience levels, and project phases.

**Solution**: Comprehensive context object with sensible defaults.

**Learning**: User context dramatically improves guidance relevance and acceptance.

---

## 🎯 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Install CAWS Dependencies

**Installed Packages**:

| Package                  | Version | Type  | Source                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `@paths.design/caws-cli` | 3.4.0   | Local | file:../../../caws/packages/caws-cli        |
| `@caws/mcp-server`       | 1.0.0   | Local | file:../../../caws/packages/caws-mcp-server |
| `chokidar`               | ^3.5.0  | NPM   | File watching library                       |
| `js-yaml`                | ^4.1.0  | NPM   | YAML parsing library                        |

**Installation Method**:

- Used file references in package.json for local CAWS packages
- Installed via npm from npm registry for chokidar and js-yaml
- Total packages added: 7 packages + dependencies

**Challenges Resolved**:

1. ❌ Initial attempt with npm install from registry failed (packages not published)
2. ❌ npm link approach didn't work properly
3. ✅ Solution: Added file references in package.json, then ran npm install

### ✅ Task 2: Test CAWS CLI Callable from V2

**Test Script**: `test-caws-integration.mjs`

**Test Results**:

```
🧪 Test 1: Importing CAWS CLI...
✅ CAWS CLI imported successfully!
   Exported functions: [ 'default', 'generateWorkingSpec', 'validateGeneratedSpec' ]

🧪 Test 2: Importing CAWS MCP Server...
✅ CAWS MCP Server imported successfully!
   Exported items: [ 'default' ]

🧪 Test 3: Importing chokidar...
✅ chokidar imported successfully!
   Has watch method: true

🧪 Test 4: Importing js-yaml...
✅ js-yaml imported successfully!
   Has load method: true
   Has dump method: true

📊 Integration Test Complete!
```

**All Tests Passing**: ✅ 4/4

**Available CAWS CLI Functions**:

- `generateWorkingSpec` - Generate working specifications
- `validateGeneratedSpec` - Validate generated specs

**Capabilities Detected**:

- ✅ Working spec validation
- ✅ Tools support
- ⚠️ Template scaffolding (limited - expected for local setup)

## 📦 Package.json Changes

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@caws/mcp-server": "file:../../../caws/packages/caws-mcp-server",
    "@paths.design/caws-cli": "file:../../../caws/packages/caws-cli",
    "chokidar": "^3.5.0",
    "js-yaml": "^4.1.0"
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

**Dependencies Removed**:

- `torch@^1.0.0` - Non-existent package
- `transformers@^3.2.0` - Not needed for current scope

---

## 🧪 Integration Test File

**File**: `test-caws-integration.mjs`

```javascript
// Test imports and verify functionality
import("@paths.design/caws-cli");
import("@caws/mcp-server");
import("chokidar");
import("js-yaml");
```

**Purpose**: Verify all packages can be imported and have expected exports

**Status**: ✅ All imports successful

---

## 📊 Verification Checklist

### Installation Verification

- [x] CAWS CLI package installed
- [x] CAWS MCP Server package installed
- [x] chokidar package installed
- [x] js-yaml package installed
- [x] All packages can be imported
- [x] CAWS CLI exports expected functions
- [x] CAWS setup detection working

### Functionality Verification

- [x] Can import CAWS CLI module
- [x] CAWS CLI exposes generateWorkingSpec
- [x] CAWS CLI exposes validateGeneratedSpec
- [x] chokidar has watch functionality
- [x] js-yaml has load/dump methods

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. **Local Package Management**

**Challenge**: CAWS packages not published to npm  
**Solution**: Use file references in package.json  
**Pattern**: `"@package/name": "file:../../../relative/path"`

**Why This Works**:

- npm treats file: protocol as local package
- Creates symlink in node_modules
- Preserves package metadata (name, version)
- Allows import by package name

### 2. **Package Name Mismatches**

**Issue**: MCP server package name is `@caws/mcp-server`, not `@paths.design/caws-mcp-server`  
**Fix**: Check actual package.json names before referencing

### 3. **Removing Non-Existent Dependencies**

**Problem**: `torch@^1.0.0` doesn't exist on npm  
**Solution**: Remove from package.json  
**Note**: PyTorch JavaScript bindings aren't maintained via npm

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 1 Day 3-4)

### Immediate Next Tasks

1. **Create CAWSValidationAdapter** (Task 3)

   - Wrap CAWS CLI validation functions
   - Convert WorkingSpec TypeScript objects to YAML
   - Parse CAWS validation results back to TypeScript

2. **Create spec-file-manager utility** (Task 4)

   - WorkingSpec ↔ YAML conversion
   - File system operations (.caws/working-spec.yaml)
   - Temporary file management

3. **Create CAWSPolicyAdapter** (Task 5)
   - Policy loading with caching
   - Budget derivation
   - Waiver management

### Architecture Direction

**Layer 1: CAWS Foundation** ✅ Complete

```
└── CAWS CLI (3.4.0)
└── CAWS MCP Server (1.0.0)
└── chokidar (file watching)
└── js-yaml (YAML parsing)
```

**Layer 2: Adapter Layer** 🔜 Next

```
└── CAWSValidationAdapter     (Day 3-4)
└── spec-file-manager         (Day 3-4)
└── CAWSPolicyAdapter         (Day 3-4)
```

**Layer 3: Arbiter Extensions** 📋 Future

```
└── ArbiterMCPServer          (Week 2)
└── BudgetMonitor             (Week 3)
└── IterativeGuidance         (Week 3)
└── ProvenanceTracker         (Week 4)
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well

1. **File References for Local Packages**

   - More reliable than npm link
   - Preserves package metadata
   - Works with standard npm workflow

2. **Test-First Verification**

   - Created test script before adapter layer
   - Verified imports work before building on them
   - Caught issues early

3. **Systematic Troubleshooting**
   - Tried npm registry → failed (expected)
   - Tried npm link → didn't work properly
   - Tried file references → success!

### What to Improve

1. **Earlier Package Name Verification**

   - Should have checked package.json names first
   - Would have saved time on incorrect package names

2. **Dependency Audit**
   - Should audit package.json before starting
   - Remove non-existent packages upfront

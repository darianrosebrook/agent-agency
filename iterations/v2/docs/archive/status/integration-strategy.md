# V2 Integration Strategy: Arbiter ‚Üî Benchmark Data ‚Üî RL Training

## Executive Summary

Agent Agency V2 represents a paradigm shift from static orchestration to a **self-improving multi-agent system**. The key innovation is that the arbiter orchestrator doesn't just coordinate agents‚Äîit systematically generates the training data needed to continuously improve those agents through reinforcement learning.

**The Three Pillars**:

1. **Arbiter Orchestration** - CAWS-enforcing orchestrator with intelligent task routing
2. **Benchmark Data Pools** - Performance metrics from every arbiter decision
3. **RL Training** - Continuous agent improvement using benchmark data

**The Core Insight**: Every routing decision, every evaluation, every success/failure becomes a training example.

## Current Implementation Status

**Overall Integration**: 60% Complete

- **Arbiter ‚Üí Data Flow**: üü¢ Operational (routing + tracking working)
- **Data ‚Üí RL Flow**: üü° Partial (export pipeline incomplete)
- **RL ‚Üí Arbiter Flow**: üü° Partial (deployment pipeline needs work)
- **Full Feedback Loop**: üü° 60% complete

## Data Flow: From Orchestration to Improvement

### Stage 1: Arbiter Makes Routing Decision

**Input**: Task arrives with context, complexity, requirements

**Process**:

```typescript
// Arbiter receives task
const task = {
  id: "TASK-001",
  type: "code-editing",
  complexity: "standard",
  requirements: ["TypeScript", "AST analysis"],
};

// Selects agent based on capability tracking
const agent = await arbiter.selectAgent(task, {
  strategy: "multi-armed-bandit",
  historicalPerformance: true,
  currentLoad: true,
});

// Logs routing decision
await benchmarkCollector.logRoutingDecision({
  taskId: task.id,
  selectedAgent: agent.id,
  routingReason: "Best success rate for AST tasks (85%)",
  alternativesConsidered: [agent2, agent3],
});
```

**Output**: Agent assignment with rationale

### Stage 2: Agent Execution & Evaluation

**Process**:

```typescript
// Agent executes task
const result = await agent.execute(task);

// CAWS evaluation
const evaluation = await cawsEvaluator.evaluate(result, {
  qualityGates: ["tests-pass", "lint-clean", "minimal-diff"],
  rubricScores: true,
  minimalDiffAnalysis: true,
});

// Performance tracking
await benchmarkCollector.logExecution({
  taskId: task.id,
  agentId: agent.id,
  success: evaluation.passed,
  qualityScore: evaluation.overallScore,
  latencyMs: result.executionTime,
  tokensUsed: result.tokenCount,
  evaluationScores: evaluation.rubricScores,
  minimalDiffMetrics: evaluation.diffAnalysis,
});
```

**Output**: Benchmark data point ready for RL training

### Stage 3: RL Training Consumption

**Process**:

```typescript
// RL trainer queries benchmark data
const trainingBatch = await benchmarkPool.getBatch({
  minDataPoints: 1000,
  taskTypes: ["code-editing", "research"],
  timeRange: "last-30-days",
  qualityThreshold: 0.7,
});

// Computes turn-level rewards
const trajectories = await rlTrainer.convertToTrajectories(trainingBatch);
const rewards = await rlTrainer.computeTurnLevelRewards(trajectories);

// Updates agent policies
const modelUpdate = await grpoTrainer.train(trajectories, rewards);

// Deploys improved agents back to arbiter
await arbiter.updateAgentCapabilities(modelUpdate);
```

**Output**: Improved agents with better task-handling capabilities

## Conclusion: The Self-Improving System

V2's innovation is not just better orchestration or better RL training‚Äîit's the **tight integration** that creates a self-improving feedback loop:

1. **Arbiter makes intelligent routing decisions** based on current agent capabilities
2. **Every decision generates training data** capturing what works and what doesn't
3. **RL training uses this data** to improve agent capabilities
4. **Improved agents are deployed back** to the arbiter
5. **Arbiter learns the new capabilities** and routes accordingly
6. **Cycle repeats continuously**

This transforms Agent Agency from a static tool into an **evolving intelligence** that gets better with every task it handles.

**Next Steps**: Implement Phase 1 (Arbiter & Performance Tracking) to begin data collection immediately.

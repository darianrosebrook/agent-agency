Benchmark testing identified **gemma3n:e2b (5.6GB)** as the optimal model, providing the best balance of speed (36.02 tokens/sec), quality (8.5/10), and resource efficiency (9.4s response time). This decision was validated against gemma3:1b (faster but lower quality at 6.2/10) and gemma3n:e4b (higher quality at 9.1/10 but slower at 23.83 tokens/sec).

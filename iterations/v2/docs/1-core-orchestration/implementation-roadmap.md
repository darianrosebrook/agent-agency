# Arbiter Orchestration: Implementation Roadmap

**Author**: @darianrosebrook

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap details the implementation of the arbiter orchestration layer—the first pillar of V2 that establishes intelligent task routing, CAWS constitutional authority, and performance tracking for RL training.

**Goal**: Deploy a production-ready arbiter that routes tasks intelligently while collecting the benchmark data needed for continuous agent improvement.

---

## POC Learnings Informing Implementation

Our POC (v0.2.0) validated core capabilities and revealed important considerations for V2 implementation:

**What Worked**:

- Multi-turn feedback (100% success rate for text transformation)
- Model selection (gemma3n:e2b optimal at 36 tokens/sec, 8.5/10 quality)
- Telemetry collection (comprehensive data across all test scenarios)
- Security isolation (zero breaches across all tests)
- Federated learning (privacy-preserving cross-agent learning operational)

**What Needs Attention**:

- Timeout optimization for complex tasks (52s for design token application)
- Dynamic timeout allocation based on task complexity
- Parallel evaluation to prevent bottlenecks
- Storage optimization for high-volume telemetry (500+ samples/day)
- Context preservation overhead (~200ms per iteration, worth it)

**Key Metrics to Target**:

- Multi-turn success: ≥95% (POC: 100% text, 80% code)
- Average latency: ≤30s (POC: 2.1s text, 25s code)
- Caching efficiency: ≥50% (POC: ~40% improvement)
- Security incidents: 0 (POC: maintained)

class ArbiterOrchestrator {
  private agentRegistry: AgentRegistryManager;
  private taskRouter: TaskRoutingManager;
  private cawsValidator: CAWSValidator;
  private performanceTracker: PerformanceTracker;

  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    await this.agentRegistry.initialize();
    await this.taskRouter.initialize();
    await this.performanceTracker.initialize();
  }

  async routeTask(task: Task): Promise<TaskAssignment> {
    // Core routing logic
    const decision = await this.taskRouter.route(task);
    await this.performanceTracker.logRoutingDecision(decision);
    return decision;
  }
}
```

**Testing**: Unit tests for agent registration and basic routing

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] Arbiter service starts successfully
- [ ] Agents can register with capability profiles

### Week 2: Multi-Armed Bandit Routing

**Goal**: Intelligent agent selection based on performance history

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement `MultiArmedBandit` class with epsilon-greedy strategy
- [ ] Add UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) scoring
- [ ] Create agent performance history tracking
- [ ] Implement exploration vs exploitation balance

**Files Created**:

- `src/orchestrator/MultiArmedBandit.ts`
- `src/orchestrator/TaskRoutingManager.ts`
- `tests/unit/multi-armed-bandit.test.ts`

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// src/orchestrator/MultiArmedBandit.ts
class MultiArmedBandit {
  async select(
    candidates: AgentProfile[],
    task: Task,
    state: BanditState
  ): Promise<RoutingDecision> {
    const epsilon = this.computeExplorationRate(state);

    if (Math.random() < epsilon) {
      return this.explore(candidates, task);
    } else {
      return this.exploit(candidates, task, state);
    }
  }

  private exploit(
    candidates: AgentProfile[],
    task: Task,
    state: BanditState
  ): RoutingDecision {
    // UCB scoring: mean + confidence interval
    const scored = candidates.map((agent) => ({
      agent,
      score: this.calculateUCB(agent, task, state),
    }));

    return scored.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)[0];
  }
}
```

**Testing**: Bandit algorithm tests, routing accuracy validation

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] Multi-armed bandit selects optimal agents
- [ ] Exploration rate decreases appropriately over time
- [ ] Routing accuracy ≥75% (will improve with more data)

**Lessons from POC**:

- In our POC, we found that task-specific performance histories were essential—text transformation success didn't predict code generation success
- Model selection matters: gemma3n:e2b at 36 tokens/sec with 8.5/10 quality provided optimal balance for multi-armed bandit decisions
- Separate tracking for multi-turn vs single-turn success rates improved routing accuracy by enabling iteration-aware assignment

// src/orchestrator/CAWSValidator.ts
class CAWSValidator {
  async validateTaskResult(
    task: Task,
    result: TaskResult,
    workingSpec: WorkingSpec
  ): Promise<CAWSValidationResult> {
    // Budget validation
    const budgetViolations = this.checkBudgets(result, workingSpec);

    // Quality gates
    const gateResults = await this.runQualityGates(result, workingSpec);

    // Check for waivers
    const waiverStatus = await this.checkWaivers(violations, workingSpec);

    // Record provenance
    await this.provenanceRecorder.record({
      taskId: task.id,
      validation: { budgetViolations, gateResults, waiverStatus },
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

    return {
      compliant: budgetViolations.length === 0 && gateResults.allPassed,
      violations: budgetViolations,
      waiverRequired: waiverStatus.needed,
      provenance: this.provenanceRecorder.getHash(),
    };
  }
}
```

**Testing**: CAWS policy enforcement tests, waiver logic validation

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] All CAWS budgets enforced
- [ ] Quality gates validated
- [ ] Provenance recorded for all tasks
- [ ] 100% CAWS compliance rate

**Lessons from POC**:

      timestamp: new Date(),
      data: decision,
    });
  }

  async logTaskExecution(

## POC-Informed Risk Mitigation

Our POC revealed specific challenges that inform V2 risk mitigation strategies:

### 1. Timeout Management

**POC Challenge**: Design token application hit 52s timeout  
**Mitigation**: Dynamic timeout allocation based on task complexity; parallel evaluation for independent criteria; task-type-specific budgets (text: 5s, code: 30s, complex: 60s)

### 2. Storage Scalability

**POC Challenge**: High-volume telemetry (500+ samples/day) strained storage  
**Mitigation**: Implement compression (60% reduction target); retention policies (hot: 7d, warm: 30d, cold: 90d); TimescaleDB for efficient time-series queries; batch writes

### 3. Iteration Overhead

**POC Challenge**: Context preservation added ~200ms per iteration  
**Mitigation**: Incremental context updates; context compression for long conversations; cache serialized context; accept overhead as necessary for quality (POC validated value)

### 4. Model Selection Complexity

**POC Challenge**: Different task types benefit from different models  
**Mitigation**: Multi-model support in routing; per-model, per-task-type performance tracking; fast models for simple tasks, quality models for complex

### 5. Evaluation Bottlenecks

**POC Challenge**: Sequential evaluation created latency bottlenecks  
**Mitigation**: Parallelize independent criteria; early failure detection; incremental evaluation (critical criteria first); cache identical results

### 6. Privacy-Performance Tradeoff

**POC Challenge**: Balancing differential privacy (ε=0.1) with model quality  
**Mitigation**: POC validated <2% quality degradation acceptable; adaptive privacy budgets; privacy-preserving federated learning; quality monitoring

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

- Specs are comprehensive and well-structured
- Parallel execution reduces timeline risk
- Clear acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Established testing patterns to follow

### Medium Risk

- Timeline assumes 2 full-time developers
- Some components may reveal unexpected complexity
- Integration testing may uncover issues

### Mitigation Strategies

- Buffer time built into estimates
- Can defer Tier 3 if timeline pressure
- Can reduce coverage targets slightly if needed
- Regular check-ins to catch issues early

---

## Conclusion

**All production hardening specs are complete and ready for implementation.**

The 12 detailed CAWS working specs provide comprehensive guidance for:

- Testing strategies (unit, integration, validation)
- Acceptance criteria (96 scenarios total)
- Quality gates (coverage, mutation, performance)
- Risk mitigation approaches
- Success metrics and timelines

**Project is ready to proceed to implementation phase.**

**Estimated Impact**: From 82% vision realized → 95% upon completion (12 weeks)

---

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Implementation  
**Next Action**: Begin Week 1 Monday environment setup  
**Timeline**: 12 weeks to 95% project completion  
**Confidence**: High (comprehensive specs, clear acceptance criteria, realistic timelines)

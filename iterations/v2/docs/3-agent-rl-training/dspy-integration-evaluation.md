    reasoning: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Explanation of scoring rationale")
    improvement_suggestions: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Specific suggestions for better performance")

# DSPy module for systematic rubric optimization
class RubricOptimizer(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.optimizer = dspy.Predict(RubricOptimization)

    def forward(self, task_context, agent_output, criteria):
        return self.optimizer(
            task_context=task_context,
            agent_output=agent_output,

}
```

**DSPy-Enhanced Approach**:

```python

# Self-optimizing judge module
class SelfImprovingJudge(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, judge_type: str):
        super().__init__()
        self.judge_type = judge_type
        self.judge = dspy.Predict(JudgeOptimization)

        return self.judge(
            judge_type=self.judge_type,
            artifact=artifact,
            ground_truth=ground_truth,
            context=context
        )

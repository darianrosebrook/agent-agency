- Quality scoring for validation

### Risk 2: Overfitting

**Status**: Mitigated ✅

- Validation sets separate from training
- A/B testing with real data
- Performance tracking detects degradation

### Risk 3: Optimization Time

**Status**: Monitored 🔄

- Expected: 10-30 minutes per module
- Mitigation: Parallel optimization for judges
- Fallback: Reduce trial count if needed

### Risk 4: Optimized Worse Than Baseline

**Status**: Mitigated ✅

- Auto-activation only if >5% improvement
- A/B testing before full deployment
- Rollback capability via ModelRegistry

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: SQLite for Storage

**Rationale**: Simplicity, local-first, no external dependencies
**Trade-off**: May need migration to PostgreSQL at scale
**Status**: Good for Phase 3

### Decision 2: Simplified Statistical Tests

**Rationale**: Balance accuracy vs complexity
**Trade-off**: Not as rigorous as full t-test
**Status**: Sufficient for current scale

### Decision 3: Synthetic Examples for Bootstrap

**Rationale**: Enables optimization before enough real data
**Trade-off**: May not represent all edge cases
**Status**: Validated with quality scorer

### Decision 4: Auto-Activation at >5%

**Rationale**: Avoid manual deployment for clear wins
**Trade-off**: Risk of false positives
**Status**: Mitigated with A/B testing

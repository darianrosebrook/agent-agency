threats:
  - threat: High-volume telemetry strains storage capacity
    likelihood: high
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Implement compression, retention policies, and time-series optimization
  - threat: Data collection overhead impacts routing latency
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Use async buffering and batch writes
  - threat: PII or secrets leaked in telemetry data
    likelihood: medium
    impact: critical
    mitigation: Implement automated scanning and anonymization validation
  - threat: Data quality degradation makes RL training ineffective
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Implement validation gates and automated cleanup

invariants:
  - All collected data passes privacy validation before storage
  - Data collection never blocks routing decisions
  - Benchmark data points are immutable once stored
  - Timestamps are millisecond-precision and monotonic
  - Storage capacity is monitored and alerts trigger before 80% full
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Routing decision is made by arbiter
    when: Performance tracker logs routing decision
    then: Data point is buffered with decision details and eventually persisted without blocking
  - id: A2
    given: Task execution completes with measurable metrics
    when: Performance tracker logs task execution
    then: Execution metrics are captured including success, latency, tokens, quality score
  - id: A3
    given: Evaluation outcome is determined
    when: Performance tracker logs evaluation outcome
    then: Full evaluation details stored including rubric scores and CAWS compliance
  - id: A4
    given: Data buffer reaches threshold size or time limit
    when: Batch write is triggered
    then: Buffered data points are validated, compressed, and written to storage in single transaction
  - id: A5
    given: Collected data point contains potential PII or secrets
    when: Privacy validation runs
    then: Data point is rejected or anonymized before storage
  - id: A6
    given: Benchmark data accumulates over time
    when: Retention policy is applied
    then: Data older than hot/warm/cold thresholds is compressed or archived appropriately
  - id: A7
    given: RL training pipeline requests benchmark data
    when: Data query is executed
    then: Data is returned in format compatible with RL training schema with complete metadata

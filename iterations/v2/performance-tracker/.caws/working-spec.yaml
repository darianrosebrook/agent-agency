risk_tier: 2
status: spec_complete

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The Performance Tracker collects comprehensive benchmark data from all agent interactions to fuel reinforcement learning training. It captures task performance metrics, routing decisions, constitutional validations, and outcome data to build rich training datasets for continuous agent improvement.
  scope:
    - Real-time performance metric collection from all agent interactions
    - Benchmark data aggregation and anonymization
    - RL training data pipeline management
    - Performance trend analysis and alerting
    - Constitutional compliance tracking in performance data
  success_criteria:
    - Capture 100% of agent task completions with full performance metadata
    - Generate RL training data within 5 seconds of task completion
    - Maintain 99.99% data integrity with zero data loss
    - Support analysis of 10,000+ concurrent agent tasks

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Performance tracking involves complex data aggregation and analysis requirements. While AI can help optimize data collection patterns and anomaly detection, the core data integrity and anonymization logic requires careful human design to ensure reliability and privacy compliance."

  risks:
    - "Performance overhead could impact system responsiveness"
    - "Data integrity issues could corrupt RL training"
    - "Privacy concerns with detailed performance data collection"

  opportunities:
    - "Well-established metrics collection patterns exist"
    - "Data aggregation logic is highly testable"
    - "TypeScript provides strong typing for complex data structures"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement comprehensive data validation and integrity checks"
    - "Use efficient data structures to minimize performance impact"
    - "Include thorough anonymization and privacy protection measures"
    - "Build extensive monitoring and alerting for data quality issues"

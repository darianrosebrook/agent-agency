## Remaining Work

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. ⏳ Fix remaining 13 ArbiterReasoningEngine tests
   - State transition expectations (5 tests)
   - Close debate prerequisites (2 tests)
   - Vote validation (4 tests)
   - Edge cases (2 tests)

2. ⏳ Run full coverage report
3. ⏳ Add missing tests for uncovered code paths
4. ⏳ Achieve 90%+ coverage goal

## Files Modified This Session

### Production Code
- `src/reasoning/EvidenceAggregator.ts` - Fixed `arguments` reserved word
- `src/reasoning/ArbiterReasoningEngine.ts` - Added missing import, fixed enum usage

### Test Code
- `tests/unit/reasoning/DebateStateMachine.test.ts` - Fixed timing precision
- `tests/unit/reasoning/ArgumentStructure.test.ts` - Fixed expectations
- `tests/unit/reasoning/EvidenceAggregator.test.ts` - Fixed test data
- `tests/unit/reasoning/ConsensusEngine.test.ts` - Fixed abstention test
- `tests/unit/reasoning/ArbiterReasoningEngine.test.ts` - Created (31 tests)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (30 minutes):
   - Fix remaining 13 test failures
   - Achieve 100% test pass rate

2. **Short-Term** (2-3 hours):
   - Run coverage report and identify gaps
   - Add tests for uncovered paths
   - Achieve 90%+ coverage

3. **Medium-Term** (1-2 days):
   - Create integration tests
   - Run mutation testing
   - Document test strategy

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Test-First Development**: Writing tests before implementation would have caught API mismatches earlier
2. **API Documentation**: Clear API documentation would have prevented incorrect test assumptions
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript's strict typing caught many bugs during compilation
4. **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive edge case testing revealed several implementation issues

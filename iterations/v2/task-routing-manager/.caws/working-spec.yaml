threats:
  - threat: Routing algorithm gets stuck in local optima
    likelihood: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Implement epsilon-greedy exploration with decay
  - threat: Bandit state corruption leads to poor routing decisions
    likelihood: low
    impact: high
    mitigation: Implement state validation and recovery mechanisms
  - threat: Cold start problem for new agents without performance history
    likelihood: high
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Use optimistic initialization and minimum sample size threshold

invariants:
  - Routing decisions are deterministic given same bandit state
  - Exploration rate decreases monotonically over time
  - All routing decisions are logged for provenance
  - UCB scores are always computed with valid statistics
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: Task requiring specific capabilities and pool of candidate agents
    when: Routing decision is requested
    then: Agent is selected based on multi-armed bandit algorithm and decision is logged with rationale
  - id: A2
    given: Bandit in exploration mode with epsilon threshold
    when: Select method is called
    then: Random or underutilized agent is selected for exploration with probability epsilon
  - id: A3
    given: Bandit in exploitation mode with agent performance history
    when: Select method is called
    then: Agent with highest UCB score is selected considering both success rate and exploration bonus
  - id: A4
    given: New agent with no performance history (cold start)
    when: Routing decision includes this agent as candidate
    then: Agent receives optimistic initialization score ensuring early trials
  - id: A5
    given: Multiple routing decisions over time
    when: Epsilon decay is applied
    then: Exploration rate decreases according to decay factor while maintaining minimum threshold
  - id: A6
    given: Task with specific capability requirements
    when: Capability matching is performed
    then: Agents are scored based on capability overlap and specialization relevance

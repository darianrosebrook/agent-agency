title: "Task Routing Manager - Intelligent Agent Selection with Multi-Armed Bandit"
version: "2.0.0"
mode: feature
risk_tier: 2
status: spec_complete

executive_summary:
  purpose: |
    The Task Routing Manager implements intelligent agent selection using multi-armed bandit algorithms to optimize task routing decisions. It balances exploration (trying new agents) with exploitation (using proven performers) while respecting CAWS constitutional constraints.
  scope:
    - Multi-armed bandit routing with epsilon-greedy and UCB scoring
    - Dynamic agent capability matching and load balancing
    - Performance-based routing decisions with constitutional compliance
    - Real-time routing metrics and decision telemetry
  success_criteria:
    - Route tasks to optimal agents within 50ms P95 latency
    - Achieve 15% improvement in task completion rates through intelligent routing
    - Maintain 99.5% routing accuracy with <0.5% erroneous assignments
    - Support 1000+ concurrent routing decisions per second

threats:
  - "Routing starvation: Some agents never selected due to poor initial performance"
  - "Over-exploration: Excessive time spent testing suboptimal agents"
  - "Load imbalance: Poor distribution leading to agent bottlenecks"
  - "Stale routing: Not adapting quickly enough to agent performance changes"

invariants:
  - "All routing decisions must complete within 100ms to avoid blocking task queues"

  - "Routing decisions must respect agent capability constraints"
  - "Performance metrics must be collected for every routing decision"
  - "Multi-armed bandit parameters must remain within constitutional bounds"

ai_assessment:
  reasoning: "Multi-armed bandit algorithms require careful parameter tuning and exploration/exploitation balancing. The routing logic must be deterministic yet adaptive, making it suitable for AI-assisted implementation with human oversight for parameter validation."

  risks:
    - "Algorithmic complexity may introduce subtle bugs in scoring logic"
    - "Performance requirements demand efficient implementation"
    - "Testing stochastic algorithms requires statistical validation"

  opportunities:
    - "Well-established MAB literature provides solid algorithmic foundation"
    - "TypeScript's type safety helps prevent routing logic errors"
    - "Comprehensive testing possible with seeded random number generation"

  recommendations:
    - "Implement with seeded randomness for reproducible testing"
    - "Include extensive statistical validation in test suite"
    - "Monitor routing performance metrics in production"
    - "Allow parameter tuning via configuration without code changes"

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Component

```bash
# 1. Read the working spec
cat components/<component-name>/.caws/working-spec.yaml

# 2. Review acceptance criteria
grep -A 50 "^acceptance:" components/<component-name>/.caws/working-spec.yaml

# 3. Set up test infrastructure (see HARDENING_KICKOFF.md)

# 4. Create test files
mkdir -p tests/unit/<module-name>
mkdir -p tests/integration/<module-name>

# 5. Begin test-driven development
```

### Tracking Progress

```bash
# Check completion status
cd iterations/v2
cat COMPONENT_STATUS_INDEX.md | grep -E "ARBITER-0(04|06|07|08|09|11|12|13|14)|RL-004|INFRA-00(1|2)"

# Run tests
npm test -- --coverage

# Check mutation score
npm run test:mutation
```

### Reviewing a Component

```bash
# 1. Review working spec
cat components/<component-name>/.caws/working-spec.yaml

# 2. Check test coverage
npm test -- --coverage <component-name>

# 3. Review acceptance criteria
# All 8 scenarios should have passing tests

# 4. Check mutation score
npm run test:mutation -- <component-name>

# 5. Validate integration
npm run test:integration -- <component-name>
```

## FAQ

### Q: Where do I start?

**A**: Read `HARDENING_KICKOFF.md` for the week-by-week guide. If you're Developer A, start with ARBITER-013 (Security). If you're Developer B, start with INFRA-002 (MCP).

### Q: What's the priority order?

**A**: Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3. Within each tier, follow the parallel track assignments in the plan.

### Q: Can we do this faster?

**A**: Yes, with more developers or by focusing on Tier 1 + Tier 2 only (8 weeks, 87% completion).

### Q: What if we find major issues?

**A**: Each working spec includes risk mitigation strategies. Escalate to tech lead if issues exceed buffer time.

### Q: How do we track progress?

**A**: Update `COMPONENT_STATUS_INDEX.md` as components reach production-ready status. Weekly reviews track against timeline.

### Q: What's "production-ready"?

**A**: All 8 acceptance criteria passing, coverage target met, mutation score met, integration tests passing, security scans clean (for Tier 1).

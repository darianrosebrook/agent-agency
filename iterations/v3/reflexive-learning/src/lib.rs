//! Reflexive Learning & Memory Integration
//! 
//! Implements the reflexive learning loop required by theory:
//! - Progress tracking with turn-level monitoring
//! - Credit assignment for long-horizon tasks
//! - Adaptive resource allocation based on learning
//! - Multi-tenant context with federated learning
//!
//! Based on V2 MultiTurnLearningCoordinator (671 lines) with Rust adaptations
//! and council integration for learning signals.

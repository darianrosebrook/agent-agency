# V3 Constitutional AI System Architecture

## Overview

Agent Agency V3 implements a **functional constitutional AI system** with operational task execution pipelines, constitutional governance framework, and basic monitoring capabilities. The system provides three execution modes (Strict, Auto, Dry-Run) for different risk levels, with constitutional council oversight framework ensuring ethical compliance and quality standards.

The architecture consists of Rust-based services communicating via HTTP APIs, with PostgreSQL persistence, comprehensive provenance tracking, and a web dashboard for monitoring and control.

## Core Problems Solved

### Autonomous Agent Safety & Governance
Modern AI agent systems lack robust safety mechanisms and accountability:

- **Execution Safety**: No safe modes for testing agent behavior without real-world impact
- **Quality Assurance**: Manual code review doesn't scale with autonomous operations
- **Intervention Gaps**: Limited ability to pause, modify, or cancel running agent tasks
- **Audit Trail Deficits**: Poor traceability of agent decisions and actions
- **Compliance Challenges**: Difficulty ensuring ethical and legal compliance in autonomous operations

V3 provides complete governance through constitutional oversight, execution modes, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Execution Mode Safety
**Problem**: Autonomous agents need safe testing without real-world impact.

**Solution**: Three execution modes provide graduated safety levels:
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Complete simulation without filesystem changes
- **Auto Mode**: Automatic execution with quality gate validation
- **Strict Mode**: Manual approval required for each execution phase

**Benefits**:
- Safe testing and validation of agent behavior
- Risk-appropriate governance intensity
- Graduated trust model for agent operations
- Protection against unintended consequences

### 2. Real-time Intervention & Control
**Problem**: Running autonomous tasks lack control mechanisms.

**Solution**: Comprehensive intervention API for task lifecycle management.

**Control Capabilities**:
- **Pause/Resume**: Suspend and restart task execution
- **Cancel**: Terminate running tasks gracefully
- **Override**: Modify task parameters and verdicts
- **Guidance Injection**: Provide additional context during execution

**Benefits**:
- Human oversight of critical operations
- Emergency response capabilities
- Dynamic adaptation to changing requirements
- Audit trail of all interventions

### 3. Constitutional Council Governance
**Problem**: Need for ethical and quality oversight in autonomous operations.

**Solution**: Four-judge council system for governance oversight.

**Judge Framework**:
- **Constitutional Judge**: Ethical compliance and CAWS validation
- **Technical Auditor**: Code quality and security standards
- **Quality Evaluator**: Requirements satisfaction and correctness
- **Integration Validator**: System coherence and architectural integrity

**Benefits**:
- Multi-dimensional quality assessment
- Ethical compliance enforcement
- Automated quality gate validation
- Structured decision-making framework

### 4. Provenance & Audit Tracking
**Problem**: Lack of accountability in autonomous agent operations.

**Solution**: Complete provenance tracking with Git integration.

**Tracking Features**:
- **Cryptographic Signing**: JWS-signed provenance records
- **Git Integration**: Commit trailers for traceability
- **Audit Trails**: Complete decision and action history
- **Compliance Verification**: Runtime validation capabilities

**Benefits**:
- Full accountability for agent actions
- Regulatory compliance support
- Incident investigation capabilities
- Quality assurance through traceability

### 5. CoreML Safety Architecture
**Problem**: Send/Sync violations when integrating CoreML FFI with async Rust.

**Solution**: Thread-confined CoreML operations with channel-based communication.

**Safety Architecture**:
- **Thread Confinement**: Raw CoreML pointers isolated to dedicated threads
- **Opaque References**: `ModelRef(u64)` identifiers safe to send across threads
- **Channel Communication**: Async coordination via `crossbeam::channel`
- **Registry System**: Thread-local mapping of references to handles

**Benefits**:
- Zero Send/Sync violations in async contexts
- Memory safety with proper resource cleanup
- High-performance inference with minimal overhead
- Safe integration with constitutional council operations

# V3 System Architecture

## Overview

Agent Agency V3 implements a **constitutional council system** where specialized judge models work together to audit, evaluate, and accept worker outputs through **constitutional concurrency** - a framework where multiple agents coordinate within agreed-upon bounds rather than competing through traditional parallelism.

The architecture coordinates specialized judges, a research agent, and a worker pool via a Rust orchestration core optimized for Apple Silicon, with built-in CAWS compliance and provenance tracking.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Constitutional Concurrency
**Traditional parallelism** races to execute operations and resolves conflicts later. **Constitutional concurrency** establishes consensus boundaries first, then executes within agreed constraints.

### 2. Council-Based Governance
Four specialized judges provide independent oversight:
- **Constitutional Judge**: CAWS compliance, budgets, waivers, provenance
- **Technical Auditor**: Code quality, security, contracts, migrations
- **Quality Evaluator**: Correctness, completeness, maintainability
- **Integration Validator**: Cross-file/API/database coherence

### 3. Risk-Tiered Execution
Tasks execute with different concurrency models based on risk:
- **Tier 1 (High Risk)**: Sequential execution with maximum oversight
- **Tier 2 (Medium Risk)**: Limited parallel with checkpoint consensus
- **Tier 3 (Low Risk)**: High parallel with minimal coordination

### 4. Apple Silicon Optimization
Native hardware acceleration across the Neural Engine (ANE), GPU, and CPU with unified memory management and thermal awareness.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Production-Ready Components (11/11)

**Core Council System:**
- **Council Coordinator**: Debate protocol with learning signals, risk-tiered execution
- **Constitutional Judge**: CAWS compliance, provenance tracking, budget enforcement
- **Technical Auditor**: Code quality analysis, security scanning, contract validation
- **Quality Evaluator**: Requirements fit assessment, acceptance criteria verification
- **Integration Validator**: Cross-system coherence, breaking change detection

**Worker & Research Systems:**
- **Research Agent**: Context synthesis, evidence gathering, cross-reference detection
- **Worker Pool**: Generalist/specialist workers with adaptive routing
- **Reflexive Learning**: Multi-turn learning coordination, continuous improvement

**Infrastructure & Security:**
- **System Health Monitor**: Agent monitoring, circuit breakers, Prometheus metrics
- **Security Policy Enforcer**: Comprehensive security controls, audit logging
- **Context Preservation Engine**: Multi-tenant context management, synthesis
- **Workspace State Manager**: Repository state management, rollback capabilities

### ðŸ”§ Key Architectural Features

**Constitutional Concurrency:**
- Risk-tiered parallelism (Tier 1: sequential, Tier 2: checkpoint, Tier 3: parallel)
- Consensus-driven coordination vs traditional race conditions
- Constitutional boundaries prevent agent conflicts

**Apple Silicon Optimization:**
- Native ANE/GPU/CPU acceleration with unified memory
- Thermal-aware execution scheduling
- Hardware-specific model quantization and placement

**CAWS Compliance & Provenance:**
- Runtime CAWS validation with evidence enrichment
- Git-backed provenance with JWS signing
- Constitutional audit trails for all decisions

**Database & Persistence:**
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search
- Multi-tenant context isolation
- Transactional integrity across all operations

## Component Interaction Patterns

### Task Execution Flow
1. **Task Submission** â†’ Router analyzes scope and risk tier
2. **Research Gathering** â†’ Context synthesis and evidence collection
3. **Worker Execution** â†’ Parallel or sequential based on risk tier
4. **CAWS Validation** â†’ Runtime compliance checking
5. **Council Review** â†’ Judge evaluation with debate protocol
6. **Final Verdict** â†’ Consensus decision with audit trail

### Concurrency Coordination
- **Low Risk (Tier 3)**: High parallelism, minimal coordination
- **Medium Risk (Tier 2)**: Limited parallel with consensus checkpoints
- **High Risk (Tier 1)**: Sequential execution with continuous oversight

### Error Recovery Patterns
- Circuit breaker patterns for component failures
- Graceful degradation based on risk tier
- Automatic rollback capabilities with provenance tracking

## Performance Characteristics

- **Constitutional Judge**: <100ms inference (ANE-optimized)
- **Technical Auditor**: <500ms analysis (GPU-accelerated)
- **Quality Evaluator**: <200ms assessment
- **Integration Validator**: <150ms coherence checking
- **Council Consensus**: <1s for Tier 2/3, <3s for Tier 1 tasks
- **Worker Execution**: <2s per request with parallel workers

Review of Autonomous Loop and Editing Capabilities in Agent-Agency V3

# Critical Review of the Self-Governing Agent v3 Plan

## Autonomous Loop Execution and Refinement

Your v3 plan outlines a **self-prompting loop controller** (`SelfPromptingLoop`) that repeatedly generates output, evaluates it, and refines the task until quality criteria are met. This approach aligns well with best practices in autonomous coding agents. In similar systems (e.g. Anthropic’s Claude Dev), the agent runs an _iterative chain-of-thought loop_ using available tools to read, modify, and test code until the task is completed[github.com](https://github.com/project-copilot/claude-dev#:~:text=Claude%20Dev%20uses%20an%20autonomous,step%20in%20his%20thought%20process). The plan’s pseudo-code for `execute_task` captures this loop structure.

One recommendation is to ensure that each iteration’s context is properly maintained. The snippet shows using `history` and `task.add_refinement_context(refinement_prompt)` to inform the next iteration. Make sure the prompt for each iteration includes **essential context**: the task description, relevant code or partial solutions, and a summary of what changed or what failed in the last attempt. This way, even if you hot-swap to a different model mid-loop, the new model has all necessary information to continue seamlessly. (Your design for a `ModelContext` and the `generate_with_context` method would handle this).

It's also wise to define an **upper bound on iterations** (as you did with `max_iterations` in the playground config) to avoid infinite loops. Combined with your satisficing checks (improvement thresholds, quality ceiling detection, etc.), this will prevent the agent from wasting time or tokens when further refinement has diminishing returns. In practice, other tools also implement safeguards like a max loop count or cost limit to cut off “rabbit holes” an LLM might go down[cefboud.com](https://cefboud.com/posts/coding-agents-internals-opencode-deepdive/#:~:text=Pretty%20powerful%20stuff,around%20agents%E2%80%94the%20payoff%20only%20grows). Your plan’s inclusion of a cost-benefit check in `SatisficingEvaluator.should_continue` is on point. Ensure that the `StopReason` captured (e.g. quality threshold reached vs. max iterations) is communicated clearly so you know _why_ the loop stopped (for logging or UI).

Finally, consider that **running tests and evaluations each iteration is crucial**. Your evaluation framework (code tests, lint, type-checks, etc.) serves as the agent’s feedback loop. This echoes what others have found: giving the LLM the ability to run a test suite on each iteration and adjust accordingly dramatically improves reliability[cefboud.com](https://cefboud.com/posts/coding-agents-internals-opencode-deepdive/#:~:text=,it%20a%20task%2C%20walk%20away). In OpenCode’s architecture, for example, the model can apply edits to code and then trigger test runs (via a bash tool), using the results to decide whether to continue iterating or stop[cefboud.com](https://cefboud.com/posts/coding-agents-internals-opencode-deepdive/#:~:text=The%20system%20prompt%20is%20given,back%20into%20the%20LLM%E2%80%99s%20context)[cefboud.com](https://cefboud.com/posts/coding-agents-internals-opencode-deepdive/#:~:text=With%20this%20new%20context%2C%20the,either%20stop%20or%20keep%20iterating). Your design should ensure that after each code generation, the relevant tests and linters are executed and their output is fed back into the loop (which it looks like you handle via `code_evaluator` and other evaluators). This closed-loop of _write → test → refine_ is the core of autonomous improvement.

## Implementing Autonomous File Editing

A key missing piece for the agent to **actually edit files on its own** is a mechanism to apply the model’s output to the project filesystem (in a controlled way). The plan defines an output as an `Artifact` (likely containing code), but you need to bridge from that artifact to real file changes. In other words, the agent needs “arms and feet” – tools to manipulate the environment[cefboud.com](https://cefboud.com/posts/coding-agents-internals-opencode-deepdive/#:~:text=A%20key%20part%20of%20a,to%20actually%20do%20useful%20work). Many coding agents implement this via explicit tool APIs: for example, Claude Dev and OpenCode provide a `write_to_file` or `edit` tool that the LLM can invoke to create or modify files[github.com](https://github.com/project-copilot/claude-dev#:~:text=1.%20,it)[cefboud.com](https://cefboud.com/posts/coding-agents-internals-opencode-deepdive/#:~:text=The%20system%20prompt%20is%20given,back%20into%20the%20LLM%E2%80%99s%20context). You might similarly design your agent to produce a structured diff or patch that the system can apply.

One approach is to have the model output unified diffs for file changes. The agent loop could take the model’s suggested diff and apply it to a sandbox copy of the code. This way, you maintain control: you can review diffs or roll them back if something goes wrong. In fact, the OpenCode community has emphasized the importance of reviewing diffs – treating the AI’s changes like a junior developer’s pull request[news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44482504#:~:text=The%20best%20experience%20I%27ve%20had,opening%20files%20in%20the%20editor). Your UI (web dashboard or CLI) could display the diff for each iteration’s changes, which is invaluable for debugging and trust.

Since your plan already integrates with a `RepositoryContext` (branch, commit hash, files modified), leveraging Git is a smart option. **Using a Git workflow**: the agent could check out a new branch or worktree at the start of its task, apply changes there, run tests, etc. If the outcome is good, you have a branch with commits of each iteration (or a final squashed commit) that can be merged. If the agent goes astray, you simply abandon that branch. This provides a built-in snapshot/rollback mechanism via Git. Indeed, you noted possibly using worktrees or snapshots – that’s an excellent idea. Not every project will be in Git, but you can at least offer this for those that are, and fall back to copying files for a “poor man’s snapshot” in non-git cases.

**Sandboxing** is important. Running the agent in an isolated context (perhaps a temporary directory or container) ensures it can’t accidentally harm the real project or system. Your autonomous executor could copy the target files into a temp workspace for the agent loop to operate, then on success, sync the changes back. This also allows you to enforce an **allow-list of files** the agent is permitted to edit: e.g. only files within the `src/` directory for the given task. An allow-list guard prevents the AI from roaming into configs or unrelated files. In your `WorkingSpec` or task definition, you might add a field for explicitly permitted paths or file patterns, and the agent’s file-writing tool should respect that.

## Guardrails and Permission Mechanisms

To safely let the agent modify code, **guardrails** are essential. You’ve recognized this by mentioning allow-lists and user notifications. A practical implementation is to have the agent ask for confirmation before applying potentially risky changes. For example, Anthropic’s Claude in “Claude Dev” mode never executes a tool (file edit, command, etc.) without user approval in the loop[github.com](https://github.com/project-copilot/claude-dev#:~:text=assist%20you%20in%20ways%20that,the%20potential%20of%20agentic%20AI)[github.com](https://github.com/project-copilot/claude-dev#:~:text=,index.html%60%2C%20which%20you). OpenCode is adding a feature for _“ask before editing files”_, where the agent will pause and present a diff, requiring the user to approve it before it’s applied[github.com](https://github.com/sst/opencode/issues/935#:~:text=). In your system, since you aim for as much autonomy as possible, you might not want to ask every time in production runs – especially if this is meant to be fully automated. In that case, consider **configurable safety modes**: e.g. a _strict mode_ where file edits and shell commands pause for user approval, versus an _autonomous mode_ where the agent can proceed on its own within the sandbox. This could even be a setting in your `working-spec.yaml` (similar to how OpenCode allows mode configuration for tools as allow/deny/ask[github.com](https://github.com/sst/opencode/issues/935#:~:text=what%20model%20you%27re%20using%20and,are%20either%20enabled%20or%20disabled)[github.com](https://github.com/sst/opencode/issues/935#:~:text=,%7D%20%7D)).

Even without a human in the loop each time, you can implement soft guardrails. For instance, **diff-based filtering**: if the agent tries to modify more lines than expected or touches files outside the task scope, you could flag that and stop or require approval. Also, incorporate sanity checks in your evaluators – e.g., a “compliance” evaluator (you mentioned CAWS compliance) could also enforce that no forbidden APIs or out-of-scope changes were introduced.

Another guardrail is **resource limiting**. Ensure the agent can’t accidentally enter an infinite loop or consume excessive tokens. Your satisficing logic covers some of this. You might also track the number of file modifications or external tool calls and set thresholds. Anthropic’s guide notes that truly autonomous scripts are usually sandboxed to avoid damaging the user’s environment[github.com](https://github.com/project-copilot/claude-dev#:~:text=assist%20you%20in%20ways%20that,the%20potential%20of%20agentic%20AI). In your case, since this agent will be editing real code, the sandbox + test approach is effectively containing any damage to a safe area until results are vetted.

## Model Management and Performance

Your plan to have a **hot-swappable model abstraction layer** is forward-thinking. This will let you experiment with different LLM providers (Ollama for local models, CoreML for on-device, OpenAI API for fallback). To make this effective, a few additional considerations:

*   **Context Consistency:** If you switch models mid-task (say after an iteration), ensure the new model is fed the full context of the task so far (history of what’s been tried and the refinement prompts). Different models might have different context lengths or formatting requirements. It might be useful to normalize the prompt format so any model can pick up where the last left off. For example, always include a recap: “We have attempted X and got result Y. Next, address criteria A and B.” in a plain language that any model can understand.
    
*   **Capability Awareness:** Your `ModelCapabilities` (max context, function calling support, etc.) should inform the loop how to use the model. If one model doesn’t support something your strategy relies on, the registry might avoid selecting it. Also consider model _speed vs. quality_. Perhaps a faster local model could be used for early iterations and a more powerful one for final polishing. This is an area for future optimization, but your design allows it by tracking performance and task affinity. For now, focus on getting one model working end-to-end; then you can iterate on selection policy (like using an epsilon-greedy as you described).
    
*   **Health Checks and Fallbacks:** It’s good that `ModelProvider` has a `health_check`. Use that to disable or swap out models that fail. For example, if your local model crashes or produces nonsense output in evaluation, the loop could decide to try a different provider on the next iteration (and emit a `ModelSwapped` event, as you planned). This increases robustness in practice. Logging the reason (e.g. “Model timed out” or “Low score output”) helps in debugging model performance issues.
    

## Integrating Reflexive Learning Feedback

Phase 4 of your plan brings the reflexive learning system into play, which is excellent for continuous improvement. To make this effective, verify that the **signals from the self-prompting loop are well-defined and useful**. For example, you proposed signals like quality improvement over iterations, model performance on tasks, and whether the agent stopped early or not. These should be fed into the `ReflexiveLearningSystem.process_self_prompting_signals` (or similar) to adjust future behavior.

Double-check if your current `ReflexiveLearningSystem` is ready to handle these new signal types. It likely wasn’t originally built with self-editing loops in mind (the snippet we saw processes more generic “council” signals[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/agent-agency/blob/be2b18a8e6a146b846908f5bf340cf562390b5b1/iterations/v3/reflexive-learning/src/lib.rs#L80-L89)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/agent-agency/blob/be2b18a8e6a146b846908f5bf340cf562390b5b1/iterations/v3/reflexive-learning/src/lib.rs#L90-L99)). You might need to extend it with new enums or data structures (as hinted by `SelfPromptingSignal` in your plan). The learning system could, for instance, adjust the _satisficing thresholds_ over time if it notices the agent often stops too early or too late. It could also learn model preferences: e.g., model X tends to succeed for front-end tasks, while model Y is better for back-end tasks – then update the `task_affinity` in your `ModelSelectionPolicy`. These kinds of dynamic adjustments will make the agent more efficient as it tackles more tasks.

Another aspect is **knowledge retention**. Consider logging the final `EvalReport` and maybe a diff of changes for each task into a knowledge base. Over time, the agent might avoid repeating mistakes if it can recall similar past tasks. This might be beyond your current scope, but reflexive learning could be the hook for it (learning from each task and storing “lessons learned”). Even without full memory implementation, tracking aggregate stats like “average iterations to success” or “common failure reasons” can inform you where the agent needs improvement.

## Observability and User Feedback

You’ve added events for each iteration (`SelfPromptingIterationStarted`, `SelfEvaluationCompleted`, etc.), which is great for observability. Make sure the **web dashboard** leverages these to show a timeline of what the agent is doing. For example, displaying iteration count, the score achieved, and a flag if it’s continuing or stopping[github.com](https://github.com/project-copilot/claude-dev#:~:text=,index.html%60%2C%20which%20you) will give you and users insight into the agent’s decision-making. Visualizing the model performance (like your planned `ModelPerformanceChart.tsx`) will also help in tuning the selection policy.

Importantly, include the **diffs or code changes** in the UI for each iteration’s output. As mentioned, seeing the actual changes is crucial for trust. If the dashboard can show “Iteration 2 changes in file X and Y (click to view diff)”, it turns the autonomous agent into something much more transparent. Users will be more willing to let it run if they can monitor and intervene if it goes off-track. This also ties into the guardrails: the user could abort the loop if they see a diff they don’t like, or conversely approve an early stop if the diff looks good even if the agent might have continued.

On the CLI side, your plan for commands like `SelfPrompt Execute` with a `--watch` flag could stream these events to the console. Perhaps it can open an interactive diff viewer or at least print a summary of each iteration (score, files changed, next action). Strive for a developer-friendly experience where the autonomous agent’s work is not a black box. Remember, as one developer commented about such tools, _“I don’t always accept the AI’s first suggestion; I treat it like a junior dev by reviewing diffs”_[news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44482504#:~:text=The%20best%20experience%20I%27ve%20had,opening%20files%20in%20the%20editor). So providing the ability to review and tweak is part of “finally getting this piece of the puzzle” working in a real-world setting.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Your v3 plan is quite comprehensive and on-target for building an autonomous coding agent. The main missing pieces to implement are **the actual file-editing actions with proper safeguards**, and tying all the components together in a testbed (your Playground). Start by implementing the simplest end-to-end flow: for example, use a single model to take a simple buggy file, have the loop fix it through iterations, apply the changes to a sandbox copy, and verify tests pass. Get that working with all the moving parts (model -> eval -> refine -> edit file -> repeat). This will flush out integration bugs between your modules (model registry, loop controller, evaluators, etc.).

As you do this, keep the **safety net** under the agent – use a throwaway git branch or temp directory so it can freely write files and you can inspect the result. Add those allow-list checks early (even just to log warnings if it tries to touch disallowed files). With a basic autonomous fix cycle running, you can then enhance it by layering on the reflexive learning feedback and multi-model support.

In summary, your design is sound and inspired by state-of-the-art agents. By implementing the file editing loop with **controlled autonomy** – iterative self-improvement, robust evaluations, and user-visible diffs/approvals – you’ll achieve an agent that truly edits files on its own while maintaining quality and safety. This combination of _automation_ and _guardrails_ is what will make your self-governing agent both powerful and trustworthy. Good luck, and happy coding!

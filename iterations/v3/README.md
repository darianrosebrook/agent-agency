# Agent Agency V3: Production Multimodal RAG System

## Overview

**Agent Agency V3** is a **production-ready multimodal RAG system** that combines constitutional AI governance with comprehensive multimodal processing capabilities. Built in Rust for memory safety and performance, it provides end-to-end processing of text, images, audio, video, and documents with real-time constitutional decision-making.

This system represents a complete evolution from research prototype to production deployment, featuring Docker-based deployment, comprehensive monitoring, and enterprise-grade security and scalability.

## System Capabilities

V3 provides comprehensive multimodal RAG capabilities with constitutional governance:

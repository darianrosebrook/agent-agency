# Agent Agency V3: Council-Based Arbiter Architecture

## Overview

V3 reimagines agent orchestration as a **constitutional council system** where specialized judge models work together to audit, evaluate, and accept worker outputs. Built ground-up for Apple Silicon with Core ML optimization, this system combines model-native CAWS understanding with runtime enforcement for maximum efficiency.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Council of Judges** - 4 specialized models for evaluation:

   - Constitutional Judge (CAWS compliance)
   - Technical Auditor (code quality & security)
   - Quality Evaluator (acceptance criteria)
   - Integration Validator (system coherence)

2. **Worker Pool** - Task execution models with CAWS awareness
3. **Research Agent** - Dedicated knowledge gathering and context building
4. **Apple Silicon Native** - Core ML optimized inference pipeline
5. **Hybrid CAWS** - Models trained on CAWS principles + runtime validation

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

- **Directory Structure** - Complete V3 project layout
- **Rust Workspace** - Cargo workspace with member crates
- **Council System** - Core types, consensus coordinator, debate protocol, verdict storage
- **Model Specifications** - YAML specs for all 4 judge models with training datasets
- **Database Schema** - Simplified PostgreSQL schema with pgvector support
- **Database Client** - Connection pooling and basic operations

### ðŸš§ In Progress

- **Worker Pool Implementation** - Task routing and CAWS self-check utilities
- **Core ML Integration** - ANE/GPU/CPU routing and quantization
- **Research Agent** - Vector search and context synthesis

### ðŸ“‹ Planned

- **Observer Bridge** - Council deliberation visualization
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Council behavior, CAWS compliance, performance tests
- **Model Fine-tuning** - CAWS training datasets and fine-tuning scripts

## Key Innovations from V2

### 1. Council > Single Arbiter

- **Problem**: V2's single orchestrator had too many responsibilities
- **Solution**: Specialized judge models with clear domains
- **Benefit**: Parallel evaluation, faster decisions, better quality

### 2. Model-Native CAWS

- **Problem**: Runtime-only enforcement is slow and repetitive
- **Solution**: Fine-tune models on CAWS principles with runtime validation
- **Benefit**: Workers self-correct, fewer violations, faster iteration

### 3. Apple Silicon Native

- **Problem**: V2 treated hardware as generic compute
- **Solution**: Core ML pipeline with ANE/GPU/CPU orchestration
- **Benefit**: 3-5x faster inference, lower power, better thermals

### 4. Research Agent Separation

- **Problem**: Workers spent tokens on information gathering
- **Solution**: Dedicated research model with vector search
- **Benefit**: Workers focus on execution, better token efficiency

### 5. Simplified Component Count

- **Problem**: 29 v2 components created integration complexity
- **Solution**: 15-20 focused v3 components with clear boundaries
- **Benefit**: Easier maintenance, faster development, clearer testing

   ```bash
   cd iterations/v3
   ```

   ```bash
   # Install PostgreSQL and pgvector
   brew install postgresql
   brew install pgvector

   # Create database

## Council System Usage

### Basic Consensus Coordination

```rust
use agent_agency_council::{ConsensusCoordinator, CouncilConfig, TaskSpec, RiskTier};

// Create coordinator with default configuration
let config = CouncilConfig::default();
let coordinator = ConsensusCoordinator::new(config);

// Create task specification
let task_spec = TaskSpec {
    id: Uuid::new_v4(),
    title: "Implement user authentication".to_string(),
    description: "Add JWT-based authentication system".to_string(),
    risk_tier: RiskTier::Tier1,
    scope: TaskScope {
        files_affected: vec!["src/auth/".to_string()],
        max_files: Some(5),
        max_loc: Some(1000),
        domains: vec!["authentication".to_string()],
    },
    acceptance_criteria: vec![],
    context: TaskContext {
        workspace_root: "/workspace".to_string(),
        git_branch: "main".to_string(),
        recent_changes: vec![],
        dependencies: std::collections::HashMap::new(),
        environment: Environment::Development,
    },
    worker_output: WorkerOutput {
        content: "Authentication implementation".to_string(),
        files_modified: vec![],
        rationale: "JWT-based auth with proper validation".to_string(),
        self_assessment: SelfAssessment {
            caws_compliance: 0.95,
            quality_score: 0.9,
            confidence: 0.85,
            concerns: vec![],
            improvements: vec![],
        },
        metadata: std::collections::HashMap::new(),
    },
    caws_spec: None,
};

// Evaluate task with council
let result = coordinator.evaluate_task(task_spec).await?;

println!("Consensus result: {:?}", result.final_verdict);
```

### Database Operations

```rust
use agent_agency_database::{DatabaseClient, DatabaseConfig, CreateJudge};

// Create database client
let config = DatabaseConfig::default();
let db = DatabaseClient::new(config).await?;

// Create a new judge
let judge = db.create_judge(CreateJudge {
    name: "Custom Judge".to_string(),
    model_name: "custom-model".to_string(),
    endpoint: "http://localhost:11434".to_string(),
    weight: 0.3,
    timeout_ms: 300,
    optimization_target: "CPU".to_string(),
}).await?;

println!("Created judge: {:?}", judge);
```

# Agent Agency V3: Rust-Based Constitutional Governance

## Overview

**Agent Agency V3** investigates constitutional AI governance through a Rust implementation, exploring how memory safety, performance characteristics, and hardware acceleration can enhance agent coordination and compliance.

This iteration examines approaches to constitutional governance using Rust's systems programming capabilities, focusing on runtime safety, performance optimization, and hardware integration.

## Research Questions

V3 investigates several key questions about constitutional governance implementation:

### Memory Safety & Governance
How can Rust's ownership model and compile-time guarantees prevent governance failures and ensure constitutional compliance?

### Performance Characteristics
What are the performance implications of implementing governance operations in a systems programming language versus higher-level approaches?

### Hardware Integration
How can specialized hardware (Apple Silicon Neural Engine, GPUs) be leveraged for efficient governance operations?

### Runtime Safety
What approaches to runtime enforcement balance performance with constitutional constraint verification?

## Technical Components

### Council System
Multi-agent decision-making with constitutional oversight mechanisms.

### Claim Extraction
Evidence-based verification and validation approaches for agent outputs.

### Context Preservation
Memory management strategies for maintaining governance state across operations.

### Reflexive Learning
Self-improvement mechanisms for judge models and governance systems.

## Getting Started

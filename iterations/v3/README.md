# Agent Agency V3: Council-Based Arbiter Architecture

## Overview

Agent Agency V3 implements a constitutional council of specialist judge models that supervise asynchronous worker agents. The workspace is built in Rust with nine coordinated crates, integrates CAWS compliance at runtime, and is optimized for Apple Silicon execution through Core ML, ANE, GPU, and CPU orchestration.

The release bundles council governance, worker execution, research assistance, benchmarking, and provenance into a single workspace. PostgreSQL with pgvector supplies persistence, while MCP integration and Apple Silicon tooling supply execution flexibility.

## Implemented Capabilities

- **Council governance** – consensus coordinator, debate protocol, verdict storage, and learning signals housed in `council/`.
- **Worker services** – task routing, lifecycle management, and compliance checks within `workers/`.
- **Research and context** – dedicated retrieval, vector search, and context synthesis in `research/`.
- **Theory-critical pipelines** – claim extraction, reflexive learning, and benchmarking crates ported from V2 and reimplemented in Rust.
- **Compliance and provenance** – CAWS runtime validator, JWS signing, and Git-backed audit trails across `orchestration/` and `provenance/`.
- **Platform foundations** – Apple Silicon optimized inference layers, database access, and MCP tooling.

## Differentiation from V2

- Council-based oversight replaces the single-orchestrator design, separating constitutional review, technical auditing, quality evaluation, and integration validation.
- CAWS principles are embedded in both model training pipelines and runtime validators, reducing the need for manual remediation.
- Apple Silicon support is first-class with Core ML integration, unified memory planning, and thermal management.
- Research responsibilities are isolated to a dedicated agent, improving worker throughput and token efficiency.
- V3 consolidates the component count into nine focused crates, simplifying maintenance and deployment.

## Delivery Status

### Completed

- Rust workspace configuration with nine crates and shared tooling.
- Council system with consensus coordination, debate flow, verdict persistence, and learning integration.
- Worker pool with routing, lifecycle management, and CAWS compliance checks.
- Research agent delivering retrieval, vector search, and context building.
- PostgreSQL/pgvector data layer, including schema and migrations.

```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with `cargo`
- PostgreSQL 15+ with the pgvector extension
- Ollama for local model serving
- Apple Silicon hardware (recommended for target performance)

### Initialization

1. Navigate into the V3 workspace:

   ```bash
   cd iterations/v3
   ```

2. **Bootstrap agent environment** (recommended for concurrent work):

   ```bash
   # Auto-detect platform and setup agent isolation
   ./scripts/bootstrap-agent.sh

   # Or manually set agent identity
   export AGENT_ID="dev-setup-$(date +%s)"
   ./scripts/bootstrap-agent.sh
   ```

3. Provision PostgreSQL and pgvector, then create the project database:

   ```bash
   brew install postgresql pgvector
   createdb agent_agency_v3
   psql agent_agency_v3 < database/schema.sql
   ```

4. Pull required baseline models via Ollama (fine-tuning happens later):

   ```bash
   ollama pull gemma3n:e2b
   ollama pull gemma3n:e4b
   ollama pull embeddinggemma
   ollama pull llama3.3:3b
   ollama pull codellama:7b
   ollama pull mistral:3b
   ```

5. Build and test the workspace:

   ```bash
   # Use optimized build wrapper for concurrent safety
   AGENT_ID="setup-build" ./scripts/build-wrapper.sh dev --workspace
   AGENT_ID="setup-test" ./scripts/build-wrapper.sh test --workspace
   ```

### Concurrent Agent Operations

For running multiple agents concurrently without resource conflicts:

- **Read the comprehensive guide**: [`CONCURRENT_AGENT_OPERATIONS.md`](./CONCURRENT_AGENT_OPERATIONS.md)
- **Use agent bootstrap**: `./scripts/bootstrap-agent.sh` for automatic environment setup
- **Use build wrapper**: `./scripts/build-wrapper.sh` instead of raw `cargo` commands
- **Follow isolation principles**: Each agent gets unique write paths and shared read caches

**Example concurrent setup:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Development agent
AGENT_ID="dev-agent-1" ./scripts/bootstrap-agent.sh
AGENT_ID="dev-agent-1" ./scripts/build-wrapper.sh dev --package council &

# Terminal 2: Test agent
AGENT_ID="test-agent-2" ./scripts/bootstrap-agent.sh
AGENT_ID="test-agent-2" ./scripts/build-wrapper.sh test --workspace &

# Terminal 3: Documentation agent
AGENT_ID="docs-agent-3" ./scripts/bootstrap-agent.sh
AGENT_ID="docs-agent-3" cargo doc --workspace &
```

## Usage Examples

### Council Coordination

```rust
use agent_agency_council::{ConsensusCoordinator, CouncilConfig, TaskSpec, RiskTier};

let config = CouncilConfig::default();
let coordinator = ConsensusCoordinator::new(config);

let task_spec = TaskSpec {
    id: Uuid::new_v4(),
    title: "Implement user authentication".into(),
    description: "Add JWT-based authentication system".into(),
    risk_tier: RiskTier::Tier1,
    scope: TaskScope {
        files_affected: vec!["src/auth/".into()],
        max_files: Some(5),
        max_loc: Some(1000),
        domains: vec!["authentication".into()],
    },
    acceptance_criteria: vec![],
    context: TaskContext::development("/workspace", "main"),
    worker_output: WorkerOutput::default(),
    caws_spec: None,
};

let result = coordinator.evaluate_task(task_spec).await?;
println!("Consensus result: {:?}", result.final_verdict);
```

### Database Operations

```rust
use agent_agency_database::{CreateJudge, DatabaseClient, DatabaseConfig};

let db = DatabaseClient::new(DatabaseConfig::default()).await?;

let judge = db.create_judge(CreateJudge {
    name: "Custom Judge".into(),
    model_name: "custom-model".into(),
    endpoint: "http://localhost:11434".into(),
    weight: 0.3,
    timeout_ms: 300,
    optimization_target: "CPU".into(),
}).await?;

println!("Created judge: {:?}", judge);
```

## Operational Targets

### Performance

- Constitutional judge inference: <100 ms (ANE-optimized)
- Technical auditor inference: <500 ms (GPU-accelerated)
- Quality evaluator inference: <200 ms
- Integration validator inference: <150 ms
- Worker task execution: <2 s per request with parallel workers

### Throughput

- 10+ concurrent workers on M3 Max (64 GB)
- 5+ concurrent workers on M3 Pro (32 GB)
- Council evaluation: <1 s for Tier 2/3 tasks, <3 s for Tier 1 tasks

### Resource Utilization

- Peak memory budget: 48 GB on M3 Max
- Idle footprint: ~12 GB with base models loaded
- Sustained thermal envelope: <80 °C
- Average power draw: <30 W under mixed ANE/CPU load

### Quality Gates

- CAWS compliance rate ≥95%
- Branch coverage ≥85% across crates
- Mutation testing thresholds and security scanning enforced before release
- Immutable provenance stored for each council decision

## Roadmap

- Finalize comprehensive automated testing and benchmarking suites.
- Complete production monitoring, alerting, and error-recovery paths.
- Deliver fine-tuned model artifacts and integration playbooks.
- Expand observer tooling for real-time deliberation visibility.

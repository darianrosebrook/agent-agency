## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.75+** (for development)
- **Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+** (for production deployment)
- **PostgreSQL 14+ with pgvector extension** (for vector storage)
- **Apple Silicon** (recommended for hardware acceleration)
- **k6** (for load testing)

### Database Setup

Agent Agency V3 requires PostgreSQL with several extensions and custom schemas. The system includes comprehensive database integration with 5 core components.

#### Quick Database Setup

```bash
# Using Docker (recommended for development)
docker run -d \
  --name agent-agency-db \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=agent_agency \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=agent_agency \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure_password_123 \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v agent_agency_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg15

# Enable required extensions
docker exec -it agent-agency-db psql -U agent_agency -d agent_agency -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgvector;"
docker exec -it agent-agency-db psql -U agent_agency -d agent_agency -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS uuid_ossp;"
```

#### Database Components

The system integrates 5 components with PostgreSQL persistence:

1. **CAWS Checker**: Stores validation results in `caws_validations` table
2. **Source Integrity**: Manages integrity records in `source_integrity_records` table
3. **Council Learning**: Queries historical data from `task_resource_history` table
4. **Claim Extraction**: Accesses knowledge bases via `external_knowledge_entities` table
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Caches insights in `analytics_cache` table with LRU eviction

#### Schema Migration

```bash
# Run migrations (from iterations/v3 directory)
cd iterations/v3
cargo run --bin migration_runner

# Or use the database package directly
cargo run --package agent-agency-database --bin migrate
```

#### Database Configuration

Set these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://agent_agency:secure_password_123@localhost:5432/agent_agency
DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20
DATABASE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_SECS=30
DATABASE_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS=60
```

#### Database Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **pgvector extension not found**: Ensure you're using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image
- **Migration failures**: Check database permissions and connection string
- **Performance issues**: Monitor with `pg_stat_activity` and optimize queries
- **Connection pooling**: Adjust `DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` based on load

**Performance Monitoring:**

```sql
-- Monitor query performance
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check connection usage
SELECT count(*) as active_connections
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active';
```

**Backup & Recovery:**

```bash
# Backup
pg_dump -U agent_agency -h localhost agent_agency > backup.sql

# Restore
psql -U agent_agency -h localhost agent_agency < backup.sql
```

### Quick Start (Production Deployment)

```bash
# Clone and navigate to V3
cd iterations/v3

# Set up environment
cp env.production.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with your configuration

# Deploy the complete system
chmod +x scripts/deploy-production.sh
./scripts/deploy-production.sh deploy

# Access services
# - API: http://localhost:8080
# - Metrics: http://localhost:8081
# - Grafana: http://localhost:3000
# - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# - Kibana: http://localhost:5601
```

### Autonomous Development Agent

Agent Agency V3 includes an autonomous self-editing development agent that can iteratively improve code through self-prompting loops. The agent provides multiple execution modes for different safety levels:

#### Execution Modes
- **Auto Mode** (default): Automatic execution with quality gate validation
- **Strict Mode**: Manual approval required for each changeset
- **Dry-run Mode**: Generate artifacts without modifying files

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run autonomous development with quality gates (recommended)
cargo run --bin self-prompting-cli -- execute "Add error handling to user service" --mode auto

# Require manual approval for changes
cargo run --bin self-prompting-cli -- execute "Refactor authentication logic" --mode strict

# Preview changes without applying them
cargo run --bin self-prompting-cli -- execute "Optimize database queries" --mode dry-run --dashboard

# Watch real-time progress with dashboard
cargo run --bin self-prompting-cli -- execute "Implement user registration" --watch --dashboard
```

#### Safety Features
- **Isolated Workspaces**: Changes applied to sandbox before promotion
- **Evaluation Gates**: Tests, linting, and type-checking required before promotion
- **Rollback Capability**: Failed evaluations automatically rollback changes
- **AllowList Enforcement**: Only permitted files can be modified
- **Model Health Monitoring**: Automatic fallback on model failures

### Development Setup

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run integration tests
cargo test --package integration-tests

# Run the system locally
cargo run
```

### Load Testing

# Install k6 (if not already installed)
# macOS: brew install k6
# Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install k6

# Run comprehensive load tests
cd load-testing
k6 run k6-multimodal-rag-test.js
```

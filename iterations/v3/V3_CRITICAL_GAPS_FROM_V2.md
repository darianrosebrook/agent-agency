# V3 Critical Gaps Analysis: What V3 Must Pull from V2

## Executive Summary

V3's Council system represents a **quantum leap in architectural sophistication** with its multi-judge debate protocol and Apple Silicon optimization. However, V3 has **critical functional gaps** that must be filled by pulling proven implementations from V2's mature verification, knowledge, and production systems.

**Bottom Line**: V3's council can make sophisticated judgments, but it lacks the **evidence gathering, knowledge integration, and production resilience** that V2 has mastered.

## üö® CRITICAL GAPS (Must Pull from V2)

### 1. Advanced Claim Processing Pipeline

**V3 Current State:**

```yaml
# V3 only has basic judge verdicts
JudgeVerdict: Pass { confidence, reasoning, evidence }
  Fail { violations, reasoning, evidence }
  Uncertain { concerns, reasoning, evidence }
```

**V2 Implementation (CRITICAL GAP):**

```typescript
// V2 has 4-stage claim verification pipeline
Stage 1: Contextual Disambiguation
  - Pronoun resolution using conversation context
  - Ambiguity detection and resolution
  - Entity reference mapping

Stage 2: Verifiable Content Qualification
  - Subjective vs objective claim detection
  - Mathematical expression parsing
  - Code behavior claim validation

Stage 3: Atomic Claim Decomposition
  - Compound sentence splitting
  - Contextual bracket addition
  - Independent claim isolation

Stage 4: CAWS-Compliant Verification
  - Multi-source evidence gathering
  - Credibility scoring and weighting
  - Confidence-based consensus
```

**Impact**: V3 judges can express opinions but cannot **validate the factual basis** of their judgments.

**Required Action**: Port V2's `ClaimExtractor.ts` and `VerificationEngine.ts` to V3's Rust ecosystem.

---

### 2. Knowledge Graph Integration

**V3 Current State:**

```rust
// V3 has basic database operations
pub struct TaskSpec {
    pub context: TaskContext,
    pub worker_output: WorkerOutput,
    // No knowledge graph integration
}
```

**V2 Implementation (CRITICAL GAP):**

```typescript
// V2 has rich knowledge integration
interface KnowledgeSeeker {
  performSemanticSearch(query: KnowledgeQuery): Promise<KnowledgeResult[]>;
  searchEntityGraph(entityId: string): Promise<EntityRelations>;
  getConfidenceScore(knowledgeId: string): Promise<ConfidenceMetrics>;
}

interface HybridSearchView {
  vector_similarity: number;
  graph_distance: number;
  confidence_score: number;
  knowledge_type: "workspace" | "external" | "agent_capability";
}
```

**Impact**: V3 judges lack access to **historical knowledge, semantic context, and confidence-scored information**.

**Required Action**: Implement V2's knowledge graph client and hybrid search views in V3.

---

### 3. Production Resilience Infrastructure

**V3 Current State:**

```rust
// V3 has basic async operations
pub async fn evaluate_task(&self, task_spec: TaskSpec) -> Result<ConsensusResult> {
    // No circuit breakers, retries, or health checks
}
```

**V2 Implementation (CRITICAL GAP):**

```typescript
// V2 has enterprise-grade resilience
class EmbeddingService {
  private circuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker;
  private rateLimiter: RateLimiter;
  private healthCheck: HealthCheck;
  private retryPolicy: RetryPolicy;

  async generateEmbedding(text: string): Promise<number[]> {
    return this.circuitBreaker.execute(async () => {
      await this.rateLimiter.checkLimit();
      return await this.retryPolicy.execute(() => this.callEmbeddingAPI(text));
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact**: V3 cannot handle **production workloads** with API failures, rate limits, or system degradation.

**Required Action**: Port V2's resilience patterns (CircuitBreaker, RetryUtils, RateLimiter, HealthCheck) to V3.

---

### 4. Evidence Gathering & Fact-Checking

**V3 Current State:**

```rust
// V3 relies on research agent for evidence
pub struct EvidenceRequest {
    pub requesting_judge: JudgeId,
    pub requested_from: EvidenceSource, // ResearchAgent only
    pub question: String,
}
```

**V2 Implementation (CRITICAL GAP):**

```typescript
// V2 has multi-source fact-checking
interface FactChecker {
  verifyClaims(claims: ExtractedClaim[]): Promise<VerificationResult[]>;
  checkAgainstSources(
    claim: string,
    sources: VerificationProvider[]
  ): Promise<Evidence[]>;
}

enum VerificationProvider {
  SnopesFactCheck = "snopes",
  GoogleFactCheck = "google",
  ScholarlyArticles = "scholar",
  CodeVerification = "code",
  MathematicalProof = "math",
}
```

**Impact**: V3 judges cannot **independently verify facts** - they must rely on external research agents.

**Required Action**: Implement V2's FactChecker and verification providers in V3.

---

## üîß HIGH PRIORITY GAPS (Should Pull from V2)

### 5. Semantic Search & Embeddings

**V3 Current State:**

```yaml
# V3 mentions research agent with vector search
# But no implementation details
```

**V2 Implementation:**

```typescript
// V2 has complete embedding infrastructure
interface EmbeddingService {
  generateEmbedding(text: string): Promise<number[]>;
  generateBatch(texts: string[]): Promise<number[][]>;
  findSimilar(query: string, topK: number): Promise<SimilarityResult[]>;
}

interface KnowledgeSeeker {
  performSemanticSearch(query: KnowledgeQuery): Promise<KnowledgeResult[]>;
  searchWorkspaceFiles(query: string): Promise<WorkspaceFileResult[]>;
  searchExternalKnowledge(query: string): Promise<ExternalKnowledgeResult[]>;
}
```

**Impact**: V3 research agents lack **efficient knowledge retrieval** capabilities.

---

### 6. Provenance & Audit Trails

**V3 Current State:**

```rust
// V3 has basic audit
pub struct JudgeEvaluation {
    pub timestamp: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    // Basic provenance only
}
```

**V2 Implementation:**

```typescript
// V2 has crypto-secured provenance
interface ProvenanceTracker {
  createEntry(operation: ProvenanceOperation): Promise<ProvenanceEntry>;
  verifyChain(entryId: string): Promise<ChainVerification>;
  getAuditTrail(operationId: string): Promise<ProvenanceEntry[]>;
}

interface CAWSProvenance {
  workingSpec: WorkingSpec;
  riskTier: RiskTier;
  evidenceChain: Evidence[];
  complianceScore: number;
}
```

**Impact**: V3 cannot provide **CAWS-compliant audit trails** for governance.

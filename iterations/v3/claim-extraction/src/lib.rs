//! Claim Extraction & Verification Pipeline
//! 
//! Implements the 4-stage claim processing pipeline required by theory:
//! 1. Contextual disambiguation
//! 2. Verifiable content qualification  
//! 3. Atomic claim decomposition
//! 4. CAWS-compliant verification
//!
//! Based on V2 ClaimExtractor.ts (1677 lines) with Rust adaptations and
//! council integration for evidence collection in debate protocol.

### 4. ✅ Model Checksum Database with Persistence
**File:** `apps/tools/caws/security-provenance.ts` (supporting functions)
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implementations:**
- **Database Storage:** `.caws/model-checksums.json` with schema:
  ```json
  {
    "modelId:version": {
      "sha256": "...",
      "md5": "...",
      "registered_at": "ISO8601",
      "verified_at": "ISO8601",
      "verified": boolean,
      "source": "auto-registered|manually-registered"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Model Location Resolution:** Checks 5 paths:
  1. Current directory (`*.mlmodel`)
  2. HuggingFace cache
  3. Local model cache (`.caws/models/`)
  4. Tests directory
  5. Version-specific naming variants
- **Lifecycle Management:** 
  - Auto-registration on first sighting
  - Expiration every 90 days
  - Reverification with integrity checks

## Architecture Decisions

### Security-First Approach
- Environment variable support for sensitive credentials
- Proper file permissions (0o700 for key directories)
- Trust chain validation for signatures
- Audit trail logging for all sensitive operations

### Database Persistence
- File-based JSON for portability
- Nested structure for model versions and checksums
- Timestamp tracking for expiration/reverification
- Graceful fallback on missing data

### Compliance & Governance
- Waiver frequency limits prevent abuse (5/week, 20/lifetime)
- Comprehensive audit logging for regulatory compliance
- Clear rejection reasons for transparency
- Usage tracking for trend analysis

## Testing Recommendations

Each completed implementation requires:
1. **Unit Tests:** Core functionality with edge cases
2. **Integration Tests:** Cross-module interactions
3. **Property-Based Tests:** Randomized input validation
4. **Performance Tests:** Benchmark critical paths
5. **Compliance Tests:** Audit trail completeness and correctness

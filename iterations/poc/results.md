## üéØ **Key Innovation Areas**

### **1. Agentic RL with Credit Assignment**

```typescript
// Agents learn from every tool call with precise credit assignment
const episode = await agenticRL.trainEpisode(taskId, {
  rewardFunction: "tool_efficiency",
  creditAssignment: "turn_level",
  minimalDiffChecking: true,
});

// Result: Agents optimize tool usage, reduce unnecessary thinking tokens
```

### **2. Thinking Budget Management**

```typescript
// Adaptive token allocation based on task complexity
const budget = await thinkingBudget.allocateBudget({
  taskId,
  complexity: "complex",
  historicalPatterns: true,
});

// Result: Optimal token usage, prevents over/under allocation
```

### **3. Federated Learning Privacy**

```typescript
// Cross-tenant learning without data exposure
const insights = await federatedLearning.getFederatedInsights(tenantId, {
  privacyLevel: "differential",
  aggregationMethod: "consensus",
});

// Result: Collective intelligence while maintaining tenant privacy
```

### **4. Context Offloading**

```typescript
// Virtual unlimited context depth
const contextRef = await contextOffloader.offloadContext(tenantId, {
  complexReasoning: true,
  temporalPatterns: true,
  compressionLevel: "aggressive",
});

// Result: No more "context rot", efficient long-term memory
```

### **5. Satisficing Evaluation**

```typescript
// "Good enough" prevents perfection paralysis
const evaluation = await evaluationOrchestrator.evaluateTask({
  taskId,
  maxIterations: 3,
  satisficingThreshold: 0.85,
  minimalDiffValidation: true,
});

// Result: Efficient iteration with quality guarantees
```

## 📊 Test Results & Performance

### Multi-turn Feedback Demonstration

**Scenario**: Text transformation with mock error injection

```
Iteration 1: ❌ Failed - Mock error: "Response contains banned phrase 'hey team'"
Feedback: "Remove all banned phrases like 'hey team', 'really casual', and 'let's make it work'"

Iteration 2: ✅ Success - Improved response addressing all feedback points
Result: Professional language maintained, banned phrases eliminated
```

**Key Achievement**: Agent demonstrated learning capability by improving response quality based on structured feedback.

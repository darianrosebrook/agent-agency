# Arbiter Execution Instructions

**Target Directory**: `/Users/darianrosebrook/Desktop/Projects/agent-agency/iterations/arbiter-poc/`

## Mission

You have constitutional authority to implement complex software systems. Your mission is to recreate the Agent Agency POC by reading the BRIEF.md specification and implementing the complete system from scratch.

## Execution Mode: AUTONOMOUS

- **No human approval required** for implementation decisions
- **Full constitutional authority** to make architectural choices
- **Self-validation** through comprehensive testing
- **CAWS compliance** enforced throughout implementation

## Your Capabilities

You have access to the V2 Arbiter infrastructure:

- **ArbiterOrchestrator**: Task management and agent coordination
- **ArbitrationProtocolEngine**: CAWS constitutional enforcement
- **ArbiterReasoningEngine**: Multi-agent debate and decision-making
- **ArbiterMCPServer**: Tool orchestration and resource management
- **Performance tracking** and quality gates
- **Database integration** (PostgreSQL + pgvector + Redis)

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Read BRIEF.md** completely and understand all requirements
2. **Design architecture** based on specifications
3. **Create project structure** (package.json, tsconfig, src/, tests/, etc.)
4. **Implement incrementally** with validation at each step
5. **Test thoroughly** to ensure all E2E scenarios pass
6. **Document decisions** and architectural choices
7. **Optimize performance** to meet SLA requirements

## Success Criteria

- All E2E tests passing (text transformation, code generation, design tokens)
- Database integration working (PostgreSQL + migrations)
- MCP server operational with tool handlers
- 70%+ test coverage achieved
- CAWS constitutional compliance maintained
- Performance SLAs met (<500ms API, <2.1s E2E)

## Begin Implementation

Start immediately upon reading this. No additional guidance will be provided.

**Execute the mission autonomously.**

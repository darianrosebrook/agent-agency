invariants:
  - Tenant data remains isolated and secure
  - Vector similarity search maintains accuracy >90%
  - Context offloading preserves critical information
acceptance:
  - id: MS-001
    given: Multi-tenant memory system initialized
    when: Tenant registers with isolation requirements
    then: Tenant data completely isolated with Row Level Security within 2 seconds
  - id: MS-002
    given: Contextual memories stored with vector embeddings
    when: Similarity search executed with query vector
    then: Top 10 most relevant memories returned within 100ms with >90% relevance accuracy
  - id: MS-003
    given: Context offloading triggered by memory limits
    when: Least relevant contexts offloaded to persistent storage
    then: Critical context preserved while maintaining system performance within 500ms
  - id: MS-004
    given: Federated learning enabled across multiple tenants
    when: Cross-tenant insights aggregated with differential privacy
    then: Collective intelligence improves without compromising individual tenant privacy

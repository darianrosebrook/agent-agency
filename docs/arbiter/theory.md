# Arbiter Stack Requirements for LLM Orchestration

## Overview and Goals

An **arbiter stack** is essentially an orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models (LLMs) and tools to work together on tasks. In this context, the arbiter (or orchestrator) acts as a decision-maker: it delegates tasks to **worker LLMs**, evaluates their outputs, and selects or refines the results according to defined quality standards. The goal is to build this arbitration logic **into the system** (rather than as a flimsy wrapper on top) so that it remains **performant, local, and effective**. In practice, this means designing a modular AI architecture where a central arbiter component manages subtasks and model interactions, ensuring the overall workflow is efficient, adaptive, and traceable.

What we are aiming for is a runtime governance system that enforces the Coding-Agent Working Standard (CAWS) during AI-assisted development. It coordinates multiple AI models (LLMs) and tools while ensuring all work complies with CAWS budgets, waivers, quality gates, and provenance requirements. The arbiter acts as a **constitutional authority** - not just a decision-maker, but the runtime enforcer of CAWS policies that no worker model can bypass.

In this architecture, CAWS becomes the **executable contract** that governs all AI contributions. The arbiter interprets CAWS clauses as system calls, verifies compliance before merge, and records immutable provenance. This transforms multi-agent orchestration from an efficiency tool into a **governance mechanism** where diligence is a first-class habit baked into the process.

Key requirements for such a CAWS-integrated arbiter stack include:

- **CAWS Constitutional Authority:** All arbitration decisions map explicitly to CAWS clauses, budgets, and waiver policies.
- **Local high-performance execution:** The system runs on powerful local hardware (e.g. Apple Silicon M-series laptops) to avoid latency and privacy issues of cloud reliance.
- **Intelligent arbitration/orchestration:** MCP-based tooling ecosystem where LLMs can discover and invoke modular tools for reasoning about outputs, handling conflicts, and enforcing CAWS quality gates through standardized, discoverable interfaces.
- **Model-agnostic and extensible design:** Worker LLMs should be pluggable and replaceable – as new, more capable models emerge, the arbiter can **hot-swap** them in and even prefer models that consistently perform better.
- **Low-level, efficient implementation:** Use performant languages and frameworks (Rust, C++, etc.) close to the metal for the runtime-critical orchestration logic, with minimal overhead.
- **Correctness, auditing, and traceability:** The system must log decisions and enable auditing of each step. The arbiter should verify outputs against CAWS rules and maintain immutable provenance chains.

Below, we break down these requirements and the components needed – essentially a “bill of materials” for the arbiter stack – along with relevant research and best practices to guide the design.

## Hardware for Local Performance

Building a **local** yet powerful AI orchestration platform starts with the right hardware. High-memory, multi-core machines like Apple’s **M-series MacBook Pros** are a strong choice. These machines feature unified memory (RAM) accessible to CPU, GPU, and the Apple Neural Engine (ANE). The unified architecture and ANE acceleration can significantly speed up ML inference. Apple’s own benchmarks show that an **8B parameter Llama model** can run at ~33 tokens/sec on an M1 Max Mac when optimized with Core ML, demonstrating that reasonably large LLMs can be run in real-time on local Mac hardware[machinelearning.apple.com](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/core-ml-on-device-llama#:~:text=This%20technical%20post%20details%20how,based%20LLMs%20of%20different%20sizes). Running models **on-device** leverages the user’s machine for cost-effective inference and keeps data private (no need to send prompts to cloud servers)[machinelearning.apple.com](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/core-ml-on-device-llama#:~:text=Many%20app%20developers%20are%20interested,both%20memory%20and%20processing%20power).

For development, using a high-memory MacBook Pro (e.g. 32GB or 64GB RAM) allows loading larger models or multiple models simultaneously. The CPU/GPU and ANE can each handle parts of the computation – Apple’s Core ML will distribute the workload across these to maximize throughput[github.com](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all/issues/2258#:~:text=,GPU%20%26%20Nural%20Engine). This means the arbiter stack can be prototyped and even deployed on a developer laptop without offloading to cloud GPUs. Of course, model size matters: extremely large models (70B+ parameters) might still be challenging to run at speed on a laptop unless quantized or run on an **M2 Ultra** or future Apple chips. But the design should anticipate continuously improving local hardware. In summary, **powerful local devices** form the base of the stack, ensuring low latency and privacy. The hardware lineup for our arbiter stack would include:

- **Developer Workstations:** M-series Macs with ample unified memory (e.g. 32–64GB) to accommodate big models. These provide CPU multicore performance, a Metal-accelerated GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine – all of which Core ML can leverage for ML tasks[machinelearning.apple.com](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/core-ml-on-device-llama#:~:text=Many%20app%20developers%20are%20interested,both%20memory%20and%20processing%20power).
- **Edge/Runtime Devices (if different):** In a production setting, if not using Macs, equivalent high-performance servers or workstations with GPUs would be needed. (For instance, an Linux server with an NVIDIA GPU if moving off Mac – but the goal here is local, so Macs might remain the target runtime as well.)
- **Acceleration Libraries:** Core ML on macOS (to utilize CPU/GPU/ANE)[machinelearning.apple.com](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/core-ml-on-device-llama#:~:text=This%20technical%20post%20details%20how,based%20LLMs%20of%20different%20sizes), or libraries like `llama.cpp` and Accelerate/Metal Performance Shaders for direct low-level ML on Apple Silicon. These ensure we fully exploit the hardware capabilities when running the models locally.

The hardware provides the raw horsepower. The next layers of the stack will ensure this power is used efficiently via smart orchestration.

## Orchestration Model and Arbitration Mechanisms

At the heart of the stack is the **arbiter/orchestrator component** – essentially the “brains” that coordinates multiple LLMs. This can be implemented as a standalone program or even as a specialized LLM (an _arbiter model_) that is designed or fine-tuned to handle orchestration. The arbiter’s responsibilities include: breaking down tasks, assigning work to one or more worker models, evaluating their outputs, resolving conflicts or inconsistencies, and composing the final result. In multi-agent AI literature, this is akin to a **centralized coordinator** agent[dominguezdaniel.medium.com](https://dominguezdaniel.medium.com/a-technical-guide-to-multi-agent-orchestration-5f979c831c0d#:~:text=3). Microsoft’s recent _Magentic-One_ system is a good example: it uses an _Orchestrator agent_ to coordinate several specialist agents (web browsing, code, etc.) and is built on a framework (AutoGen) that is **model-agnostic** (works with different LLM backends like GPT-4)[dominguezdaniel.medium.com](https://dominguezdaniel.medium.com/a-technical-guide-to-multi-agent-orchestration-5f979c831c0d#:~:text=Microsoft%20recently%20announced%20Magentic,4o). Our arbiter would play a similar top-level role.

One critical design question is **how the arbiter makes decisions** and judges outputs. We have the option to leverage an LLM’s reasoning ability here. For instance, we can have each worker LLM provide not just an answer but also a rationale – essentially “pleading its case” for why its output is correct. The arbiter (which might itself be an LLM acting as a judge, or a coded heuristic) then compares these arguments and decides the winner. Research shows this _LLM debate_ approach can improve factual accuracy: two models debate a point over several rounds, and a separate **judge model** (with access only to the debate arguments, not the raw data) decides which side is more correct[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=In%20this%20post%2C%20we%20demonstrate,decides%20which%20side%20is%20correct)[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=correct,which%20summary%20choice%20is%20correct). In an AWS study, two LLMs were tasked with defending different summaries of a transcript (one correct, one incorrect) over 3 debate rounds, and a judge LLM determined which summary was factually consistent – effectively identifying the correct one[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=In%20this%20post%2C%20we%20demonstrate,decides%20which%20side%20is%20correct)[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=correct,which%20summary%20choice%20is%20correct). This kind of arbitration via debate could be built into our stack: when multiple candidate outputs or strategies are available, the arbiter could spawn a mini-debate between models or prompt the worker model to justify its solution, then evaluate those justifications.

Even without an explicit multi-turn debate, the arbiter can use an LLM for **reasoning and verification**. For example, after a worker model produces a result, the arbiter might ask a smaller “verification model” to double-check the result or find errors. This concept is similar to having an _overseer_ or _critic_ agent. In complex systems, **conflict resolution** is a known challenge – the arbiter must handle cases where different agents’ outputs conflict[dominguezdaniel.medium.com](https://dominguezdaniel.medium.com/a-technical-guide-to-multi-agent-orchestration-5f979c831c0d#:~:text=1,Protecting%20against%20misuse%20or%20vulnerabilities). Having a reasoning mechanism (like a rule-based judge or an LLM judge) helps systematically resolve such conflicts. The stack should include this arbitration logic, possibly as:

- **Built-in Judging Module:** This could be a separate LLM (which can be small/fast) that scores or chooses between outputs. For instance, a 7B parameter model fine-tuned to act as a judge could be used to rank answers. Notably, the AWS experiment found that even a relatively small model (Mistral 7B) can serve effectively as a judge, and one can swap in larger judges for more complex reasoning if needed[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=The%20choice%20of%20judge%20and,The%20model%20cards%20for). This means the arbitration model itself can be adjusted based on the task complexity.
- **Self-Consistency & Voting:** Another approach the arbiter stack could use is running one model multiple times and taking a majority vote or the most consistent answer (this is known as _self-consistency_ in prompting[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=The%20LLM%20debating%20technique%20can,mentioned%20below%20in%20this%20post)). Or, have multiple different models attempt the task in parallel and then pick the result that is most common or cross-verify answers. These techniques, while less explicit than a debate, still rely on an arbiter mechanism to decide which output to trust.
- **Integrated Orchestration Agent:** In the long term, one could imagine training a specialized model (or fine-tuning an existing one) to take in the state of the task and outputs of workers and directly produce the orchestrated result. This would “bake in” the arbitration logic. However, current practice leans toward a modular approach – using a separate orchestration program or agent to oversee the worker models.

In summary, the arbiter stack will contain an **orchestration layer** that can reason about tasks and outputs. Whether implemented with code, a dedicated model, or a combination, it will ensure the system doesn’t simply rely on one model’s output blindly. Instead, it applies rules, cross-checks, or even LLM-based debate to **prioritize correct and high-quality results**[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=correct,which%20summary%20choice%20is%20correct). This is the core of building the custom arbitration (“CAWS” arbitration, as you referred to it) _into_ the system’s foundation rather than slapping a superficial wrapper around an LLM.

## Model-Agnostic Design and Hot-Swapping Capability

To keep the system **future-proof and flexible**, the arbiter architecture must be **model-family agnostic**. In practice, this means the orchestrator should be able to work with different underlying LLMs (OpenAI GPT series, Anthropic Claude, Meta’s Llama/Mistral, etc.) and even switch between them on the fly. As new models emerge with better capabilities or efficiency, we should be able to “hot swap” them into the system with minimal changes.

Achieving this requires an abstraction layer between the arbiter logic and the actual model APIs. Many orchestration frameworks already emphasize this: for example, Microsoft’s AutoGen framework allows agents to use **various AI models** (OpenAI, Azure, or custom local models) interchangeably[research.aimultiple.com](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-orchestration/#:~:text=AutoGen%2C%20developed%20by%20Microsoft%2C%20is,task%20automation%20using%20conversational%20agents). Similarly, the AWS Multi-Agent Orchestrator is designed to integrate with **different deployment environments** – cloud services like Lambda or local setups – and perform intelligent **query routing** to the appropriate agent or model[dominguezdaniel.medium.com](https://dominguezdaniel.medium.com/a-technical-guide-to-multi-agent-orchestration-5f979c831c0d#:~:text=AWS%20introduced%20the%20Multi,setups%2C%20and%20other%20cloud%20platforms). In our stack, the arbiter could use a routing policy to decide _which_ model to assign a task to, based on the task type, model strengths, or past performance.

**Hot-swapping models** implies a few things:

- **Pluggable Model Interfaces:** Define a common interface for invoking models (e.g., a function that takes a prompt and returns a completion, regardless of whether the model is local or an API). This could be facilitated by using libraries like Hugging Face’s pipelines or a custom wrapper that normalizes different model backends. The stack’s configuration might list available models (by name, size, or capabilities) and the arbiter can choose among them.
- **Performance Tracking & Preference:** The arbiter should **keep track of each model’s performance** on various tasks. For instance, it can log success/failure or quality scores for tasks completed by each model. Over time, this creates a record of which model tends to be most effective for each category of task. The arbiter can then weight its choices accordingly (giving preference to models with higher success rates for the current task type). This is analogous to a reinforcement learning or multi-armed bandit approach: the system “learns” which expert is best for a given job. If Model A consistently produces more accurate code or answers than Model B, the arbiter will route future similar requests to Model A first. (If Model A is unavailable or fails, Model B could still be tried as backup – ensuring redundancy.)
- **Dynamic Model Selection:** In some cases, the arbiter might use multiple models concurrently for speed. For example, it could launch a query to a small fast model and a large accurate model at the same time – if the fast model’s answer passes certain checks, use it; otherwise wait for or fall back to the accurate model. This **speculative execution with multiple models** is a pattern discussed in the LLM engineering community to balance latency vs accuracy. The orchestrator effectively does a _race_: use the first acceptable result. This requires the arbiter to have criteria for “acceptable” (perhaps a quick validation step).
- **Example – Hybrid Routing:** A concrete scenario could be: The arbiter gets a task. By default, it tries the most capable model (say GPT-4 or a local Llama 70B) for quality, but that might be slow. It also tries a faster local 13B model. If the 13B model returns a result that the arbiter’s checks find satisfactory, it cancels the GPT-4 call to save time. If not, it waits for GPT-4’s answer. This kind of **latency-optimized orchestration** ensures the system meets performance targets while still using heavyweight models when necessary. In effect, the arbiter is managing a pool of models and choosing **the right model for the right task at the right time**.

Crucially, being model-agnostic also means if _a new model family_ comes along (say a new open-source LLM with better efficiency), we can integrate it without redesigning the whole stack. As long as it adheres to the interface, the arbiter can start routing tasks to it and observe how it performs. The AWS blog on LLM debates echoed this flexibility: the **choice of judge model and debater models can range from very small to very large**, depending on the task, and one should experiment by switching models in and out to see performance differences[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=The%20choice%20of%20judge%20and,The%20model%20cards%20for). Our system should make such experimentation easy – essentially a _plug-and-play architecture for LLMs_.

To implement this, the stack might include a **configuration file or registry of models** with their parameters (addresses, expected strengths, cost, etc.), and an **Arbiter Engine** that can load/unload models or direct queries to them. There could also be a **router component** (could be a simple if-else logic or a small ML classifier) that directs tasks to a particular model or set of models. For example, open-source frameworks like LangChain have the concept of a “RouterChain” that first classifies an input and then chooses a model or prompt template accordingly[cudocompute.com](https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/llms-ai-orchestration-toolkits-comparison#:~:text=B.%20Multi,RouterChain%20intelligently). We can adopt a similar idea so that the selection is automated based on either input attributes or historical outcomes.

In summary, **model agnosticism** in the arbiter stack ensures it is not tied to any single AI model or vendor. It will manage a **swappable pool of LLMs**, and use intelligent routing to pick the best model for each job. This not only protects us against rapid advances (we can incorporate new models quickly) but also allows continuous optimization of the system’s quality and efficiency by favoring the _current_ top performers[dominguezdaniel.medium.com](https://dominguezdaniel.medium.com/a-technical-guide-to-multi-agent-orchestration-5f979c831c0d#:~:text=Microsoft%20recently%20announced%20Magentic,4o)[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=The%20choice%20of%20judge%20and,The%20model%20cards%20for).

## Low-Level Implementation and Performance Considerations

To meet performance requirements, especially as we scale up the number of agents/models and the complexity of tasks, the implementation of the arbiter stack should be as **close to the metal** as feasible. While Python is currently the lingua franca for AI experimentation (with frameworks like LangChain, etc.), it comes with interpreter overhead and GIL constraints that could bottleneck a high-throughput orchestration system. Therefore, for the _runtime orchestration engine_ (the part that will actually run in production handling requests), languages like **Rust or C++** are preferable. They offer much better raw performance, low-level hardware control, and thread-safe concurrency without a GIL, which is important for parallel task orchestration.

Several teams have recognized this and started creating orchestration frameworks in Rust/C++ to combine performance with AI workflows. For example, **Graph-Flow** is a Rust-based multi-agent workflow framework that emphasizes high performance and type safety for complex AI orchestration[github.com](https://github.com/a-agmon/rs-graph-llm#:~:text=High). It provides a graph execution engine, state management, and conditional routing in a compiled, efficient package. The author notes that the goal was to bring the capabilities of Python frameworks (like LangChain/LangGraph) into Rust for production-grade systems, benefiting from Rust’s speed and robustness[github.com](https://github.com/a-agmon/rs-graph-llm#:~:text=This%20framework%20follows%20the%20same,the%20ground%20up%20in%20Rust). Likewise, there are Rust libraries (e.g., the `llm-chain` crate, or orchestrators like **Orch** and **swarms-rs**) aimed at unifying multi-LLM operations with minimal overhead. One advantage of Rust/C++ is that we can interface directly with optimized inference libraries – for instance, we can call the C++ **llama.cpp** library (for running LLaMA models) directly from Rust, or use NVIDIA’s TensorRT for running models on GPU – without the overhead of Python in the loop. This allows the heavy lifting (matrix multiplies, etc.) to happen at near C/C++ speeds, and our orchestrator can coordinate concurrently.

That said, Python can still be invaluable during **development and prototyping**. We might start by using Python to glue models together (since frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, etc., allow quick experimentation). But as the design firms up, critical components should be rewritten or optimized in a lower-level language. One possible approach is a hybrid: use Python for the high-level logic initially, but ensure that performance-critical paths (model inference calls, parallel executions, data moves) use native extensions or are offloaded to C++ backends. For example, if using an open-source model, we could use a Python binding to a C++ library so that generating output doesn’t block the Python event loop more than necessary.

**Why Rust/C++ over pure Python?** For one, the arbiter might need to handle many tasks in parallel (especially if we allow multiple models to run concurrently). Python threads won’t truly run in parallel due to the GIL (unless using multiprocessing, which adds overhead). In contrast, Rust/C++ threads can efficiently utilize all CPU cores. Additionally, if the orchestrator is maintaining shared state or logs, Rust’s type safety and ownership model help prevent race conditions and memory errors, increasing reliability for a long-running service. A lean, compiled orchestrator also has a smaller deployment footprint and can be easier to embed in various environments (for instance, a Rust binary could potentially run on a server, an edge device, or be integrated into an iOS app for on-device orchestration, etc., whereas Python would require a heavier runtime).

Another angle is **closer-to-metal for inference**: On Apple Silicon, using Core ML (as mentioned earlier) involves Swift or C++ APIs beneath the hood. We might end up writing some Swift or Objective-C++ to load a Core ML model and run it on the ANE. That logic could be wrapped in a Rust or C++ orchestrator. The bottom line is that as we approach the deployment phase, we want minimal overhead between the arbiter’s decision loop and the hardware doing the computation[news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41031824#:~:text=If%20you%20wanted%20to%20embed,cpp%20binding)[news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41031824#:~:text=My%20main%20motivation%20was%20a,response%20generation%20with%20error%20correction). Every extra millisecond added by Python interpreting could be saved by a compiled approach, which adds up in a pipeline of multiple agents and verifications.

In terms of **specific components** at this layer, the stack would include:

- An **Orchestration Engine Service** (likely a daemon or library) implemented in Rust/C++. This would handle the core loop of receiving a task, breaking it into sub-tasks, dispatching to models, awaiting results, and combining outcomes. It will use asynchronous concurrency (e.g. `async/.await` in Rust or multi-threading in C++) to manage parallel model calls and I/O.
- **Bindings to Model Runtimes:** For each type of model integrated, we either call out to an API (for remote models) or use a local runtime. Local runtimes might include:

  - A Core ML runtime (possibly via Apple’s C++ frameworks or using Python with `coremltools` during development, then moving to Swift/C++ for prod).
  - The **llama.cpp** library or similar for running GGML models on CPU/Metal – there are C APIs and even Rust crates to call llama.cpp.
  - ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for other neural nets, if needed for specialized tasks.
  - These can be linked into the orchestrator process for efficiency. If the model is remote (like OpenAI API), the orchestrator will manage HTTP calls efficiently (possibly batching or streaming responses).

- By using a systems language, we also open the door to more fine-grained optimizations: for example, if we know certain small utility models (like a classifier or a regex-based tool) are needed, we can implement them directly in code rather than calling an external service, shaving off overhead.

Overall, **the plan is to prototype quickly (perhaps with Python), but implement the final arbiter stack core in Rust/C++ for maximal performance**. This ensures that as we scale up the number of agents or incorporate more complex arbitration logic, the framework itself is not the bottleneck. It also aligns with the requirement that as we get closer to runtime/inference, we want to be near the hardware – leveraging native threads, SIMD instructions, GPU cores, etc., without unnecessary abstraction penalties.

## Ensuring Correctness and Traceability

Finally, a critical requirement for the arbiter stack is **correctness and traceability**. Because this system will be autonomously making decisions (which model to use, which answer to accept, etc.), we need a robust way to trace those decisions and audit the system’s behavior. In practice, this translates to two things: **(a)** building in evaluation/verification steps so that the system’s outputs meet our quality standards (correctness), and **(b)** logging and monitoring every key action (traceability/auditability).

For **correctness**, the arbiter stack should incorporate automated checks at various points in the workflow. Some measures include:

- **Validation Tests:** If the task is something that can be automatically checked (for example, if a coding task, run test cases on the code; if a math problem, verify the equation solution), the arbiter should perform that check before considering the task done. This could be a separate “verification agent” or simply a function in the orchestrator that runs the appropriate test suite. Only if the output passes does the arbiter mark it as successful; otherwise it might trigger a retry or try a different model.
- **Consistency and Rule Enforcement:** The arbiter can enforce format or content rules. If a response should contain certain sections or keywords (per a style guide), the arbiter checks the output for those. If something is missing or seems off, it can prompt the model to correct it. Essentially, the arbiter acts as an editor or quality control.
- **Arbiter as an Auditor:** If using an LLM as the arbiter, we can prompt it to explicitly critique the output: e.g., “Does the solution provided fully address the query? Is it free of errors? Explain.” This transforms the arbiter into an auditor role, and it can then decide to approve the result or not based on this analysis. Such self-checking loops (sometimes called _reflection_ or _self-refinement_ loops) have been shown to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.10039v1#:~:text=generated%2C%20the%20system%20enters%20a,vector%20databases%20to%20fetch%20additional)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.10039v1#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20the%20orchestration%20engine%20tackles,of%20hallucinations%20and%20improving%20overall). Indeed, the multi-LLM orchestration paper outlines a _reflective iteration_ where the orchestrator evaluates if the answer is adequate and, if not, revisits the knowledge sources to improve it[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.10039v1#:~:text=generated%2C%20the%20system%20enters%20a,vector%20databases%20to%20fetch%20additional). Our arbiter should include a similar mechanism for iterative refinement when needed.

For **traceability**, every decision and action should be logged. This serves both debugging and accountability purposes. Key things to log include: which model was chosen for a task and why, what output it gave, how the arbiter evaluated that output (any scores or reasoning), and if a second model was used or a retry happened. Essentially, we want an **audit trail** that could later be reviewed to understand the system’s behavior on a given task. This is analogous to how orchestration frameworks in enterprise maintain logs and event histories – for AI orchestration, it’s even more crucial. In fact, one of the benefits of AI orchestration is introducing such **governance safeguards**: frameworks emphasize **audit trails and intervention checkpoints** to keep AI decisions transparent and correct[cudocompute.com](https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/llms-ai-orchestration-toolkits-comparison#:~:text=orchestration%20frameworks%20enforce%20safeguards%2C%20such,drift%2C%20bias%2C%20and%20compliance%20gaps). By designing our arbiter stack from the start with logging in mind, we ensure we can always answer “which model contributed what and how did we end up with this result?”.

Modern orchestration platforms often have built-in monitoring dashboards and evaluation tools. For example, **Orq AI** (an orchestration platform) highlights **real-time monitoring, traces, and custom evaluators** to ensure LLM output quality[research.aimultiple.com](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-orchestration/#:~:text=,Augmented%20Generation%20%28RAG%29%20pipelines). We should incorporate a similar notion: perhaps a lightweight dashboard or simply well-structured logs that can be analyzed. If a particular model starts drifting (producing lower quality output over time), the logs/metrics would reveal that, and the arbiter could adjust (either automatically through its performance tracking or manually by developers). Moreover, if there's ever a need to **audit** a particular output (say for compliance or debugging), the trace should show the entire sequence: model X produced Y, arbiter noted a factual error Z, so arbiter invoked model W to correct, etc., along with timestamps.

Another aspect of traceability is **versioning**: as we update models or prompts, we should version them so that we know which version was used for a given output. This prevents confusion if an output is later reviewed. The stack might include a simple database or file store that records each task and outcome, the models (and their versions/checkpoints) used, and whether the result was accepted. This echoes the idea of _explicit state management with audit trails_ that orchestration systems strive for[cudocompute.com](https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/llms-ai-orchestration-toolkits-comparison#:~:text=orchestration%20frameworks%20enforce%20safeguards%2C%20such,drift%2C%20bias%2C%20and%20compliance%20gaps)[cudocompute.com](https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/llms-ai-orchestration-toolkits-comparison#:~:text=explicit%20state%20management%2C%20enabling%20detailed,with).

Finally, because the orchestrator mainly deals with decisions and coordination (which are less compute-intensive than generating large texts), we can afford these extra checks and logging without hurting overall throughput too much. The arbiter’s decision loop will typically be faster than the LLMs’ inference time (e.g., evaluating a model’s answer might take a few milliseconds, whereas the model took a few seconds to generate it). Thus, we trade a bit of overhead for a **huge gain in reliability**. By prioritizing decisions and rules over sheer generation, the orchestrator ensures the final outputs meet our quality bar. In other words, **speed is achieved not by rushing outputs, but by intelligently orchestrating and vetting them** – this results in a more correct result faster than having to manually fix errors later. The orchestrator’s lightweight auditing steps still likely cost less time than a full generation run, so it’s a worthwhile investment in the pipeline.

**In summary**, the arbiter stack will include comprehensive logging, verification steps, and possibly an oversight model, all aimed at **correctness and traceability**. These features make the system robust and trustworthy. Should anything go wrong or need improvement, we can audit the process and adjust rules or models accordingly, confident that we have a clear view into the "why" behind each output. This turns the multi-LLM pipeline into a **governable, observable process rather than a black-box**[cudocompute.com](https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/llms-ai-orchestration-toolkits-comparison#:~:text=in%20economic%20value%20by%202028,ai%20%20across%20enterprise%20workflows)[research.aimultiple.com](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-orchestration/#:~:text=,Augmented%20Generation%20%28RAG%29%20pipelines).

## High-Quality Claim Extraction and Factual Verification

Drawing inspiration from Microsoft Research's **Claimify** framework for extracting high-quality claims from language model outputs, the arbiter stack incorporates sophisticated claim extraction and verification mechanisms to ensure factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations in multi-agent orchestration.

### The Claim Extraction Challenge

Traditional fact-checking approaches often struggle with complex, highly detailed LLM outputs because they attempt to evaluate entire texts at once. The **claim extraction** strategy breaks down complex outputs into simple, verifiable factual statements that can be independently validated. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends critically on the quality of extracted claims - inaccurate or incomplete extractions compromise the entire verification process.

The arbiter stack addresses this challenge through a **three-stage claim processing pipeline**:

### Stage 1: Disambiguation and Context Resolution

**Ambiguity Detection**: The arbiter identifies instances where source text contains multiple possible interpretations that could lead to different factual claims.

```typescript
interface ClaimDisambiguation {
  // Identify ambiguous phrases that require context resolution
  detectAmbiguities(
    text: string,
    context: ConversationContext
  ): Promise<AmbiguityInstance[]>;

  // Resolve ambiguities using available context
  resolveAmbiguity(
    ambiguousPhrase: string,
    context: ConversationContext
  ): Promise<ResolutionResult>;
}

interface AmbiguityInstance {
  phrase: string;
  possibleInterpretations: string[];
  contextDependency: boolean;
  resolutionConfidence: number;
}
```

**Context-Aware Resolution**: When ambiguities can be resolved using available context, the system proceeds to claim extraction. When context is insufficient for definitive interpretation, the system labels the text as "Cannot be disambiguated" and excludes it from claim extraction to prevent false factual assertions.

### Stage 2: Precise Claim Decomposition

**Atomic Claim Extraction**: Following Claimify's methodology, the arbiter decomposes complex statements into atomic, verifiable claims that can be independently fact-checked.

```typescript
interface ClaimExtractor {
  // Extract atomic claims from disambiguated text
  extractClaims(
    text: string,
    context: ConversationContext
  ): Promise<ExtractedClaim[]>;

  // Validate claim completeness and accuracy
  validateClaims(
    claims: ExtractedClaim[],
    sourceText: string
  ): Promise<ValidationResult>;
}

interface ExtractedClaim {
  id: string;
  statement: string;
  confidence: number;
  sourceContext: string;
  verificationRequirements: VerificationCriteria[];
}
```

**Quality Assurance**: The system ensures that extracted claims are:

- **Atomic**: Each claim makes a single, specific factual assertion
- **Complete**: All verifiable information from the source is captured
- **Accurate**: Claims precisely reflect the source text without distortion
- **Traceable**: Each claim can be mapped back to its source context

### Stage 3: CAWS-Compliant Verification

**Evidence-Based Validation**: Extracted claims are validated against CAWS standards, requiring verifiable evidence within declared budgets and scope boundaries.

```typescript
interface CAWSClaimVerification {
  // Verify claims against CAWS evidence requirements
  verifyClaimEvidence(
    claim: ExtractedClaim,
    evidence: EvidenceManifest
  ): Promise<VerificationResult>;

  // Check claim compliance with CAWS budgets
  validateClaimScope(
    claim: ExtractedClaim,
    workingSpec: WorkingSpec
  ): Promise<ScopeValidation>;
}

interface VerificationResult {
  status: "VERIFIED" | "UNVERIFIED" | "INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE";
  evidenceQuality: number;
  cawsCompliance: boolean;
  verificationTrail: VerificationStep[];
}
```

### Integration with Arbiter Decision Making

**Claim-Based Arbitration**: The arbiter uses extracted and verified claims as the foundation for evaluating worker model outputs, ensuring decisions are based on factual accuracy rather than rhetorical persuasiveness.

```typescript
interface ClaimBasedArbiter {
  // Evaluate worker outputs using claim extraction
  evaluateWithClaims(
    workerOutput: WorkerOutput,
    taskContext: TaskContext
  ): Promise<ClaimBasedEvaluation>;

  // Compare competing outputs using claim verification
  compareOutputs(
    outputs: WorkerOutput[],
    verificationCriteria: VerificationCriteria
  ): Promise<ArbitrationDecision>;
}

interface ClaimBasedEvaluation {
  extractedClaims: ExtractedClaim[];
  verificationResults: VerificationResult[];
  factualAccuracyScore: number;
  cawsComplianceScore: number;
  overallQuality: number;
}
```

### Advanced Claim Processing Features

**Multi-Modal Claim Extraction**: The system extends beyond text to handle claims in code, documentation, and structured data outputs.

```typescript
interface MultiModalClaimProcessor {
  // Extract claims from code outputs
  extractCodeClaims(
    codeOutput: CodeOutput,
    specification: CodeSpecification
  ): Promise<CodeClaim[]>;

  // Extract claims from documentation
  extractDocumentationClaims(
    docOutput: DocumentationOutput,
    styleGuide: DocumentationStandards
  ): Promise<DocumentationClaim[]>;

  // Extract claims from data analysis outputs
  extractDataClaims(
    analysisOutput: DataAnalysisOutput,
    dataSchema: DataSchema
  ): Promise<DataClaim[]>;
}
```

**Continuous Learning from Verification**: The system learns from claim verification outcomes to improve extraction accuracy and reduce false positives.

```typescript
interface ClaimLearningSystem {
  // Learn from verification feedback
  learnFromVerification(
    claims: ExtractedClaim[],
    verificationResults: VerificationResult[],
    humanFeedback?: HumanFeedback
  ): Promise<LearningUpdate>;

  // Adapt extraction patterns based on task surface
  adaptExtractionPatterns(
    taskSurface: TaskSurface,
    historicalPerformance: PerformanceMetrics
  ): Promise<PatternUpdate>;
}
```

### Standardized Evaluation Framework

Drawing from the research framework in "Towards Effective Extraction and Evaluation of Factual Claims" [arXiv:2502.10855](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10855), the arbiter stack implements a comprehensive evaluation system for claim extraction quality.

**Research-Based Evaluation Metrics**:

```typescript
interface ResearchBasedClaimEvaluation {
  // Coverage metrics (from Metropolitansky & Larson 2025)
  coverageMetrics: {
    factualCoverage: number; // % of factual content successfully extracted
    semanticCoverage: number; // % of semantic meaning preserved
    contextualCoverage: number; // % of contextual information retained
  };

  // Decontextualization quality (novel approach from research)
  decontextualizationMetrics: {
    selfContainment: number; // Claims can be understood without source context
    ambiguityReduction: number; // % reduction in ambiguous interpretations
    precisionRetention: number; // % of original precision maintained
  };

  // Automated evaluation methods
  automatedEvaluation: {
    claimCompleteness: number; // Automated assessment of claim completeness
    factualAccuracy: number; // Automated fact-checking against knowledge bases
    consistencyScore: number; // Internal consistency across extracted claims
  };
}
```

**Scalable Evaluation Pipeline**:

```typescript
interface ScalableClaimEvaluation {
  // Replicable evaluation methods from research
  evaluationPipeline: {
    batchProcessing: boolean; // Process multiple claims simultaneously
    parallelVerification: boolean; // Parallel fact-checking across claims
    cachingStrategy: "semantic" | "exact" | "hybrid"; // Cache verification results
  };

  // Research-backed quality thresholds
  qualityThresholds: {
    minimumCoverage: 0.85; // 85% factual coverage required
    minimumDecontextualization: 0.8; // 80% self-containment required
    maximumAmbiguity: 0.15; // <15% ambiguous claims allowed
  };

  // Automated quality gates
  qualityGates: {
    preExtractionValidation: boolean; // Validate input before extraction
    postExtractionVerification: boolean; // Verify claims after extraction
    continuousMonitoring: boolean; // Real-time quality monitoring
  };
}
```

### Quality Metrics and Monitoring

**Enhanced Claim Quality Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring incorporating research-backed metrics for claim extraction accuracy, verification success rates, and factual consistency across the arbiter stack.

```typescript
interface EnhancedClaimQualityMetrics {
  // Research-based extraction quality metrics
  extractionMetrics: {
    accuracy: number; // % of correctly extracted claims
    completeness: number; // % of verifiable content captured
    precision: number; // % of extracted claims that are factual
    recall: number; // % of factual content successfully extracted
    coverage: number; // Research-based coverage metric
    decontextualization: number; // Research-based self-containment metric
  };

  // Enhanced verification performance metrics
  verificationMetrics: {
    verificationRate: number; // % of claims successfully verified
    evidenceQuality: number; // Average evidence strength
    cawsCompliance: number; // % of claims meeting CAWS standards
    ambiguityResolution: number; // % of ambiguities successfully resolved
    contextualPreservation: number; // % of context preserved in claims
  };

  // System health indicators with research backing
  healthIndicators: {
    hallucinationRate: number; // % of outputs containing unverified claims
    claimConsistency: number; // Consistency across multiple extractions
    processingLatency: number; // Average claim extraction time
    evaluationReliability: number; // Reliability of automated evaluation
    scalabilityMetrics: number; // Performance under load
  };
}
```

### Claim Extraction and Verification Implementation

**Multi-Stage Claim Processing**: The arbiter stack implements a approach with three distinct stages for optimal claim extraction and verification.

```typescript
interface ClaimExtractionAndVerificationProcessor {
  // Stage 1: Selection - Identify verifiable content
  selectionStage: {
    detectVerifiableContent(
      sentence: string,
      context: ConversationContext
    ): Promise<VerifiableContentResult>;

    rewriteUnverifiableContent(
      sentence: string,
      context: ConversationContext
    ): Promise<string | null>; // Returns null if no verifiable content
  };

  // Stage 2: Disambiguation - Resolve ambiguities
  disambiguationStage: {
    identifyAmbiguities(
      sentence: string,
      context: ConversationContext
    ): Promise<AmbiguityAnalysis>;

    resolveAmbiguities(
      sentence: string,
      ambiguities: AmbiguityAnalysis
    ): Promise<DisambiguationResult>;
  };

  // Stage 3: Decomposition - Extract atomic claims
  decompositionStage: {
    extractAtomicClaims(
      disambiguatedSentence: string,
      context: ConversationContext
    ): Promise<AtomicClaim[]>;

    addContextualBrackets(
      claim: string,
      impliedContext: string
    ): Promise<string>; // e.g., "John [celebrity] called for peace [in Middle East]"
  };
}

interface VerifiableContentResult {
  hasVerifiableContent: boolean;
  rewrittenSentence?: string; // Only if unverifiable content was removed
  confidence: number;
}

interface AmbiguityAnalysis {
  referentialAmbiguities: string[]; // e.g., "they", "the policy", "next year"
  structuralAmbiguities: string[]; // e.g., multiple grammatical interpretations
  canResolve: boolean; // Whether context provides sufficient resolution
  resolutionConfidence: number;
}

interface DisambiguationResult {
  success: boolean;
  disambiguatedSentence?: string;
  reason?: "no_ambiguity" | "resolved" | "cannot_resolve";
}

interface AtomicClaim {
  id: string;
  statement: string;
  contextualBrackets: string[]; // Implied context in brackets
  sourceSentence: string;
  confidence: number;
}
```

**Ambiguity Handling**: Unlike traditional methods that ignore or assume resolution of ambiguities, the arbiter stack explicitly identifies when ambiguity cannot be resolved and excludes such content from fact-checking.

```typescript
interface AmbiguityHandler {
  // Identify unresolvable ambiguities (unique to Claimify approach)
  detectUnresolvableAmbiguities(
    sentence: string,
    context: ConversationContext
  ): Promise<UnresolvableAmbiguity[]>;

  // Handle different types of ambiguity
  handleReferentialAmbiguity(
    ambiguousPhrase: string,
    context: ConversationContext
  ): Promise<ResolutionAttempt>;

  handleStructuralAmbiguity(
    sentence: string,
    possibleInterpretations: string[],
    context: ConversationContext
  ): Promise<ResolutionAttempt>;
}

interface UnresolvableAmbiguity {
  type: "referential" | "structural" | "temporal";
  phrase: string;
  possibleInterpretations: string[];
  reason:
    | "insufficient_context"
    | "multiple_valid_readings"
    | "external_knowledge_required";
}

interface ResolutionAttempt {
  success: boolean;
  resolvedPhrase?: string;
  confidence: number;
  fallbackStrategy?: "exclude_from_verification" | "request_human_review";
}
```

### Integration with CAWS Governance

**Provenance Tracking**: Every extracted claim is tracked through the CAWS provenance system, creating immutable audit trails for factual assertions.

**Waiver Management**: Claims that cannot be verified within CAWS budgets trigger appropriate waiver processes, ensuring transparency about verification limitations.

**Quality Gates**: Claim extraction and verification become integral components of CAWS quality gates, with specific thresholds for factual accuracy and evidence quality.

This claim extraction and verification system transforms the arbiter from a simple output selector into a **factual accuracy guardian**, ensuring that all AI-generated content meets rigorous standards for truthfulness and verifiability while maintaining CAWS compliance and governance requirements.

## CAWS-Compliant Arbitration Protocol

Every arbitration round follows the **CAWS Adjudication Cycle**, extending Section 5 of the Coding-Agent Working Standard:

| Stage            | Description                                                                 | Enforcement Mechanism                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Pleading**     | Worker submits `change.diff`, rationale, and evidence manifest.             | JSON RPC to Arbiter                   |
| **Examination**  | Arbiter checks CAWS budgets (`max_loc`, `max_files`) and structural diffs.  | Rust validator using CAWS schemas     |
| **Deliberation** | Arbiter runs verifier tests; collects gate metrics.                         | Local plug-ins: build, lint, coverage |
| **Verdict**      | Arbiter issues PASS / FAIL / WAIVER_REQUIRED.                               | Signed YAML verdict record            |
| **Publication**  | Arbiter commits verdict + provenance to git with trailer `CAWS-VERDICT-ID`. | Git CLI integration                   |

No model may self-modify budgets or waiver paths; only the Arbiter runtime, acting under CAWS, can authorize such changes.

## Arbiter Reasoning Engine

When multiple local LLMs propose competing patches, the Arbiter orchestrates an internal **CAWS Debate**:

- Each Worker is instructed to _"defend its diff"_ using evidence and rationale clauses.
- Arbiter evaluates arguments under CAWS Article 7 (Proof and Verification): _"Claims shall be accepted only when substantiated by verifiable evidence within the bounds of declared budgets."_
- Arbiter scores each plea across:

  - **Evidence Completeness (E)**: all required proofs present
  - **Budget Adherence (B)**: within declared scope
  - **Gate Integrity (G)**: tests pass without waiver
  - **Provenance Clarity (P)**: rationale ↔ diff ↔ evidence alignment

- Final score `S = 0.4E + 0.3B + 0.2G + 0.1P`.
  Highest-score submission is accepted; others logged as "superseded."

A compact reasoning LLM (e.g., 3-7 B parameters, Core ML-optimized) can serve as a linguistic judge. Its prompt template cites CAWS clauses directly, e.g.: _"Under CAWS Section 5.2, evaluate whether this waiver justification meets 'documented necessity' and 'time-bounded exception' requirements."_

## Reflexive Learning & Memory Integration

The arbiter stack incorporates advanced reflexive capabilities drawn from V1/V2 research to enable continuous learning, progress tracking, and adaptive orchestration. These reflexive systems transform the arbiter from a static coordinator into a learning orchestrator that improves over time.

### Memory System Integration

**Multi-Tenant Context Offloading**: Workers maintain state through federated learning engines that preserve context across sessions without data sharing between tenants.

```typescript
interface ContextOffloader {
  // V1: Multi-tenant memory with context preservation
  offloadContext(
    tenantId: string,
    conversationId: string,
    context: ConversationContext
  ): Promise<ContextHandle>;

  // V2: Thinking budget integration
  allocateThinkingBudget(
    contextHandle: ContextHandle,
    taskComplexity: TaskSurface
  ): Promise<ThinkingBudget>;
}
```

**Federated Learning Engine**: Enables cross-tenant learning while maintaining privacy through differential privacy and model aggregation without raw data exchange.

### Progress Tracking & Turn-Level Monitoring

**Trajectory Analysis**: The arbiter maintains detailed progress tracking through turn-level reward assignment and credit allocation for long-horizon tasks.

```typescript
interface ProgressTracker {
  // V2: Turn-level RL training infrastructure
  trackTurnProgress(
    taskId: string,
    turnNumber: number,
    action: AgentAction,
    outcome: TurnOutcome
  ): Promise<ProgressUpdate>;

  // Credit assignment for multi-turn tasks
  assignCredit(
    trajectory: TurnTrajectory[],
    finalOutcome: TaskOutcome
  ): Promise<CreditAssignment[]>;
}
```

**Rubric Engineering Framework**: Systematic reward design with explicit weights adapted to different task surfaces (code-editing, research, data-analysis).

### Adaptive Resource Allocation

**Thinking Budget Management**: Treats thinking as an optimizable resource with automatic allocation based on task complexity and progress monitoring.

```typescript
interface AdaptiveResourceManager {
  // V1: Rubric engineering with multi-term weights
  computeWeightedReward(
    taskSurface: TaskSurface,
    metrics: PerformanceMetrics
  ): Promise<WeightedReward>;

  // V2: Environment abstraction for RL interface
  createAdaptiveEnvironment(
    taskSpec: TaskSpec,
    workerCapabilities: WorkerCapabilities
  ): Promise<AdaptiveEnvironment>;
}
```

### Failure Mode Detection & Mitigation

**Curriculum Learning System**: Structured skill progression with specific mitigations for RL instability and reward hacking prevention.

```typescript
interface FailureMitigationSystem {
  // V1: Specific mitigations for common failure modes
  detectFailureMode(
    trajectory: TurnTrajectory[],
    metrics: PerformanceMetrics
  ): Promise<FailureMode | null>;

  // V2: Curriculum-based learning progression
  adjustDifficulty(
    workerId: string,
    currentPerformance: PerformanceMetrics,
    curriculumStage: CurriculumStage
  ): Promise<DifficultyAdjustment>;
}
```

### Reflexive Learning Loop

The arbiter implements a complete reflexive learning cycle:

1. **Observation**: Track worker progress, resource utilization, and outcome quality
2. **Analysis**: Apply rubric engineering to evaluate performance across multiple dimensions
3. **Learning**: Update routing policies, resource allocation strategies, and curriculum progression
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust worker assignments, budget allocations, and task difficulty dynamically

```typescript
interface ReflexiveArbiter extends Arbiter {
  // Continuous learning from worker performance
  learnFromOutcomes(
    completedTasks: TaskResult[],
    timeWindow: TimeWindow
  ): Promise<LearningUpdate>;

  // Adaptive worker routing based on historical performance
  routeWithLearning(
    task: Task,
    availableWorkers: Worker[],
    context: RoutingContext
  ): Promise<WorkerAssignment>;

  // Curriculum-based task progression
  adjustTaskDifficulty(
    workerId: string,
    recentPerformance: PerformanceMetrics
  ): Promise<TaskDifficulty>;
}
```

### Scalability & Privacy Considerations

**Federated Privacy-Preserving Learning**: Cross-tenant model improvement without data sharing through secure aggregation protocols.

**Horizontal Scaling**: Reflexive components scale independently:

- Memory offloading services scale per tenant
- RL training workers scale horizontally
- Progress tracking databases shard by tenant/conversation

**Observability Integration**: All reflexive operations maintain comprehensive audit trails for CAWS compliance and debugging.

## Model Performance Benchmarking & Evaluation System

The arbiter stack includes a comprehensive benchmarking system to evaluate, score, and continuously update the pool of available models. This ensures optimal model selection while maintaining CAWS governance standards.

### Benchmarking Cadence & Methodology

**Continuous Micro-Benchmarks**: Daily automated evaluation of active model pool.

```typescript
interface BenchmarkingCadence {
  // Daily: Active model pool health checks
  microBenchmarks: {
    frequency: "daily";
    scope: "active-models";
    metrics: ["latency", "success-rate", "caws-compliance"];
    duration: "30 minutes";
  };

    frequency: "monthly";
    trigger: "model-release-announcements";
    scope: "upcoming-models";
    duration: "8 hours";
  };
}
```

**Benchmark Dataset Management**:

        "visualization-tasks",
        "statistical-analysis"
      ];
      metrics: ["accuracy", "performance", "schema-compliance"];
    };
  };

  // Controlled dataset evolution
  datasetUpdates: {
    frequency: "quarterly";
    validation: "cross-model-consensus";
    archival: "rolling-12-months";
  };
}
```

### Scoring System & Performance Metrics

**Multi-Dimensional Scoring Framework**:

```typescript
interface ModelPerformanceScore {
  // Primary KPIs (weighted for model selection)
  primary: {
    taskCompletionRate: number; // 0-1: Success rate across task surfaces
    cawsComplianceScore: number; // 0-1: Adherence to CAWS standards
    efficiencyRating: number; // 0-1: Token usage vs. quality achieved
    toolAdoptionRate: number; // 0-1: Effective tool usage
  };

  // Secondary KPIs (monitoring and alerting)
  secondary: {
    latencyPercentile: number; // P95 response time
    rewardHackingIncidents: number; // Per-month violation count
    hallucinationRate: number; // Factual consistency score
    contextRetention: number; // Multi-turn coherence
  };

  // Meta-metrics (system health)
  meta: {
    benchmarkStability: number; // Consistency across benchmark runs
    trainingDataFreshness: number; // How recently model was updated
    deploymentHealth: number; // Infrastructure reliability
  };

  // Composite score for ranking
  compositeScore: number; // 0-1: Weighted combination of all metrics
}
```

**Dynamic Weighting by Task Surface**:

```typescript
const surfaceWeights: Record<TaskSurface, ScoreWeights> = {
  "code-editing": {
    taskCompletionRate: 0.35,
    cawsComplianceScore: 0.3,
    efficiencyRating: 0.2,
    toolAdoptionRate: 0.15,
  },
  "research-assistant": {

    cawsComplianceScore: 0.25,
    efficiencyRating: 0.15,
    toolAdoptionRate: 0.2,
  },
};
```

### "Good Enough" Performance Criteria

**Tiered Performance Thresholds**:

```typescript
interface PerformanceThresholds {
  // Minimum viable performance (MVP)
  minimumViable: {
    taskCompletionRate: 0.75; // 75% success rate
    cawsComplianceScore: 0.85; // 85% CAWS compliance
    compositeScore: 0.7; // 70% overall score
  };

  // Production-ready performance
  productionReady: {
    taskCompletionRate: 0.85; // 85% success rate
    cawsComplianceScore: 0.95; // 95% CAWS compliance
    compositeScore: 0.8; // 80% overall score
  };

  // Best-in-class performance
  bestInClass: {
    taskCompletionRate: 0.92; // 92% success rate
    cawsComplianceScore: 0.98; // 98% CAWS compliance
    compositeScore: 0.88; // 88% overall score
  };

  // Degradation alerts
  degradationThresholds: {
    performanceDrop: 0.05; // 5% drop triggers investigation
    complianceDrop: 0.02; // 2% compliance drop triggers alert
    consecutiveFailures: 3; // 3 consecutive benchmark failures
  };
}
```

**Adaptive Baseline Adjustment**:

```typescript
interface AdaptiveBaselines {
  // Rolling baseline calculation
  baselineCalculation: {
    window: "90-days"; // Rolling performance window
    percentile: 0.75; // 75th percentile as baseline
    minimumSamples: 20; // Minimum benchmark runs
  };

  // Seasonal adjustment
  seasonalAdjustment: {
    enabled: true;
    factors: [
      "model-updates",
      "infrastructure-changes",
      "task-complexity-shifts"
    ];
  };

  // Task surface specific baselines
  surfaceBaselines: Record<TaskSurface, AdaptiveBaseline>;
}
```

### New Model Evaluation Pipeline

**Monthly New Model Assessment**:

```typescript
interface NewModelPipeline {
  // Model discovery sources
  discoverySources: [
    "huggingface-daily", // Daily model releases
    "arxiv-ml-papers", // Research paper releases
    "model-leaderboards", // Benchmark leaderboard updates

      duration: "8-hours";
      criteria: [
        "head-to-head-comparison",
        "cost-benefit-analysis",
        "integration-complexity"
      ];
      passThreshold: "beats-baseline-by-0.05";
    };
  };

  // Integration decision framework
  integrationCriteria: {
    performanceImprovement: 0.1; // 10% better than current best
    costEfficiency: 0.15; // 15% better cost-performance ratio
    integrationComplexity: "low"; // Low engineering overhead
    stabilityPeriod: "30-days"; // 30 days of stable performance
  };
}
```

### Model Update & Retirement Strategy

**Model Lifecycle Management**:

```typescript
interface ModelLifecycle {
  // Update triggers
  updateTriggers: {

      "user-feedback"
    ];
  };
}
```

### Integration with Reflexive Learning

**Performance-Driven Model Selection**:

```typescript
interface ReflexiveModelSelection {
  // Real-time routing decisions
  async selectOptimalModel(
    task: Task,
    availableModels: Model[],
    context: RoutingContext
  ): Promise<ModelSelection> {
    // Query current performance scores
    const scores = await this.getCurrentScores(availableModels);

    // Apply task-specific weighting
    const weightedScores = this.applySurfaceWeights(scores, task.surface);

    // Factor in historical performance
    const adjustedScores = await this.applyHistoricalPerformance(
      weightedScores,
      task.tenantId
    );

    // Select with exploration-exploitation balance
    return this.selectWithExploration(adjustedScores, context);
  }

  // Continuous learning from routing outcomes
  async learnFromRoutingDecisions(
    decisions: RoutingDecision[],
    outcomes: TaskOutcome[]
  ): Promise<ModelUpdate> {
    // Update performance models
    // Adjust exploration rates
    // Refine selection algorithms
  }
}
```

### Observability & Reporting

**Benchmark Dashboard & Alerts**:

```typescript
interface BenchmarkObservability {
  // Real-time monitoring
  realTimeMetrics: {
    modelHealthDashboard: "grafana";
    performanceAlerts: "pagerduty";
    benchmarkPipelineStatus: "argo-workflows";
  };

  // Reporting cadence
  reports: {
    daily: ["model-health-summary", "benchmark-completions"];
    weekly: ["performance-trends", "model-comparison-matrix"];
    monthly: ["new-model-evaluations", "system-improvement-plan"];
    quarterly: ["strategic-model-roadmap", "infrastructure-investments"];
  };

  // Stakeholder communications
  communications: {
    alerts: ["performance-degradation", "new-model-opportunities"];
    reports: ["monthly-performance-review", "quarterly-strategy-update"];
    notifications: ["benchmark-completions", "model-updates"];
  };
}
```

This comprehensive benchmarking system ensures the arbiter stack continuously optimizes model selection while maintaining CAWS governance standards, adapting to new models and performance changes through systematic evaluation and learning.

## Arbiter & Worker Runtime Optimization Strategy

Drawing from the Kokoro TTS optimization blueprint, we can apply similar hyper-tuning approaches to optimize both the arbiter orchestrator and worker models. The key insight is that "fastest inference" alone isn't sufficient - we need **precision engineering of the entire runtime stack** while preserving CAWS compliance and task quality.

### Arbiter Runtime Optimization (Orchestrator Performance)

**Multi-Stage Decision Pipeline** (inspired by Kokoro's 3-stage lock-free pipeline):

```typescript
interface OptimizedArbiterRuntime {
  // Stage 1: Fast-path classification (similar to Kokoro's text processing)
  async classifyTaskComplexity(task: Task): Promise<TaskProfile> {
    // Sub-50ms assessment using lightweight models
    // Categorize: trivial/standard/complex by surface + context
  }

  // Stage 2: Worker selection & routing (similar to Kokoro's provider heuristics)
  async routeWithOptimizations(
    task: Task,
    availableWorkers: Worker[]
  ): Promise<OptimizedAssignment> {
    // Apply reflexive learning + performance scores
    // Consider worker specialization, current load, historical performance
    // Use bandit algorithms for exploration-exploitation balance
  }

  // Stage 3: Execution orchestration (similar to Kokoro's dual sessions)
  async orchestrateWithDualExecution(
    assignment: OptimizedAssignment
  ): Promise<TaskResult> {
    // Primary worker for current segment
    // Secondary worker pre-computing next segments
    // Backpressure-aware concurrency control
  }
}
```

**Arbiter Performance Budgets** (aligned with Kokoro's SLOs):

- **Decision Latency**: <50ms for task classification and routing
- **Throughput**: 1000+ tasks/minute sustained
- **Memory Footprint**: <500MB for arbiter process
- **CPU Utilization**: <20% baseline, <40% peak

### Worker Model Optimization (Individual Agent Performance)

**Precision & Graph Engineering** (directly analogous to Kokoro's quantization strategy):

```typescript
interface WorkerOptimizationProfile {
  // Model precision optimization (Kokoro's INT8 + mixed FP16 approach)
  precision: {
    weights: "per-channel-int8" | "hybrid-fp16";
    activations: "dynamic-range" | "static-range";
    calibrationData: CalibrationDataset;
  };

  // Graph optimization (Kokoro's ORT format + static shapes)
  graph: {
    format: "ort" | "onnx-optimized";
    shapes: "static-max" | "dynamic-batched";
    passes: ["constant-folding", "fuse-matmul-add", "eliminate-dead-code"];
  };

  // Execution provider selection (Kokoro's Core ML vs MPS heuristics)
  execution: {
    primaryProvider: "coreml-ane" | "mps" | "cuda";
    fallbackProvider: "cpu-openmp";
    heuristics: ProviderHeuristics;
  };
}
```

**Worker-Specific Optimization Profiles**:

```typescript
const workerOptimizationProfiles: Record<
  TaskSurface,
  WorkerOptimizationProfile
> = {
  "code-editing": {
    // Precision-critical: maintain FP16 for code understanding
    precision: { weights: "hybrid-fp16", activations: "static-range" },
    graph: { format: "ort", shapes: "static-max" },
    execution: { primaryProvider: "coreml-ane", fallbackProvider: "mps" },
  },
  "research-assistant": {
    // Speed-critical: aggressive quantization acceptable
    precision: { weights: "per-channel-int8", activations: "dynamic-range" },
    graph: { format: "ort", shapes: "dynamic-batched" },
    execution: { primaryProvider: "mps", fallbackProvider: "coreml-ane" },
  },
};
```

### Pipeline Optimization (End-to-End Task Flow)

**Streaming Task Execution** (inspired by Kokoro's streaming pipeline):

```typescript
interface StreamingTaskPipeline {
  // Pre-computation phase (Kokoro's primer strategy)
  async prepareTaskExecution(task: Task): Promise<TaskPreparation> {
    // Analyze task structure and dependencies
    // Pre-load relevant contexts and tools
    // Allocate computing resources
  }

  // Chunked execution (Kokoro's chunk cadence approach)
  async executeInChunks(
    task: Task,
    chunkSize: number = 3
  ): Promise<AsyncIterable<TaskChunkResult>> {
    // Break complex tasks into executable chunks
    // Yield results as they complete
    // Maintain execution state across chunks
  }

  // Continuous optimization (Kokoro's persistent daemon concept)
  async maintainExecutionState(
    taskId: string,
    state: ExecutionState
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Persist intermediate results
    // Maintain context across execution sessions
    // Enable resumable task execution
  }
}
```

**Quality Preservation During Optimization**:

```typescript
interface QualityGuardrails {
  // CAWS compliance validation (similar to Kokoro's quality validation)
  complianceChecks: {
    cawsValidation: "pre-execution" | "post-execution" | "continuous";
    waiverAuditing: "automatic" | "human-review-required";
    provenanceTracking: "immutable-chain";
  };

  // Performance-quality trade-off monitoring
  tradeOffMetrics: {
    speedVsAccuracy: number; // 0-1 scale
    resourceVsQuality: number; // 0-1 scale
    optimizationOverhead: number; // Acceptable degradation %
  };

  // Fallback mechanisms
  fallbackStrategies: {
    precisionFallback: "fp16-on-quality-drop";
    providerFallback: "cpu-on-failure";
    chunkSizeAdjustment: "increase-on-underrun";
  };
}
```

### Continuous Measurement & Auto-Tuning

**Bayesian Optimization Framework** (directly from Kokoro's auto-tuning approach):

```typescript
interface ArbiterAutoTuner {
  // Performance parameter space (Kokoro's parameter optimization)
  parameterSpace: {
    chunkSize: [1, 5, 10]; // Tasks per chunk
    concurrencyLevel: [2, 4, 8]; // Parallel workers
    memoryArenaSize: [512, 1024, 2048]; // MB
    providerSelection: ["coreml", "mps", "cpu"];
  };

  // Multi-objective optimization (similar to Kokoro's Pareto optimization)
  objectives: {
    minimize: ["latency", "resource-usage"];
    maximize: ["throughput", "caws-compliance"];
    constraints: ["quality-thresholds"];
  };

  // Continuous learning loop
  async optimizeContinuously(): Promise<void> {
    while (true) {
      const currentConfig = await this.getCurrentConfig();
      const performanceData = await this.collectPerformanceData();

      const optimizedConfig = await this.bayesianOptimize(
        currentConfig,
        performanceData,
        this.parameterSpace,
        this.objectives
      );

      await this.applyOptimizedConfig(optimizedConfig);
      await this.validateQualityImpact(optimizedConfig);

      await this.wait(this.tuningInterval); // e.g., daily
    }
  }
}
```

### Apple Silicon-Specific Optimizations

**ANE/Core ML Integration** (directly applicable from Kokoro):

```typescript
interface AppleSiliconOptimizations {
  // Core ML execution provider tuning
  coreML: {
    modelFormat: "MLProgram" | "neuralnetwork";
    computeUnits: "ALL" | "CPUAndGPU" | "CPUOnly";
    memoryArenaSize: number; // Tune 2-4GB based on model size
  };

  // MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) optimization
  mps: {
    enableFP16: boolean;
    enableAsync: boolean;
    threadCount: number;
  };

  // Provider selection heuristics (from Kokoro's experience)
  providerHeuristics: {
    shortTasks: "coreml-ane"; // <2 seconds execution time
    mediumTasks: "mps"; // 2-10 seconds
    longTasks: "cpu-openmp"; // >10 seconds, sustained throughput
  };
}
```

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Measurement & Profiling** (1-2 weeks)

- Implement comprehensive benchmarking for arbiter and workers
- Profile current bottlenecks and performance characteristics
- Establish quality baselines with CAWS compliance validation

**Phase 2: Precision & Graph Optimization** (2-3 weeks)

- Apply INT8 quantization to worker models where quality allows
- Optimize ONNX graphs with static shapes and operator fusion
- Implement provider-specific execution optimizations

**Phase 3: Pipeline & Concurrency Optimization** (2-3 weeks)

- Implement streaming task execution with chunking
- Add dual-session execution for overlapping computation
- Optimize arbiter decision pipeline for sub-50ms latency

**Phase 4: Auto-Tuning & Continuous Optimization** (2-3 weeks)

- Deploy Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning
- Implement continuous performance monitoring
- Add adaptive quality-preservation mechanisms

**Success Metrics** (aligned with Kokoro's 2.7x improvement target):

- Arbiter decision latency: <50ms (from current ~100ms)
- Worker throughput: 2-4x improvement while maintaining CAWS compliance
- End-to-end task completion: 40% faster with equivalent quality
- Resource efficiency: 30-50% reduction in compute requirements

This optimization strategy applies the same rigorous, quality-preserving approach that delivered exceptional results for Kokoro TTS to the arbiter stack, ensuring we optimize for both speed and compliance without sacrificing the CAWS governance standards.

## Conclusion and Bill of Materials

Bringing it all together, what does the **CAWS-integrated arbiter stack** look like in concrete terms? Here's a breakdown of the components and requirements we need to implement or procure:

1.  **CAWS Constitution:** The Coding-Agent Working Standard becomes the executable governance layer, with `working-spec.yaml`, `policy.yaml`, `waiver.schema.json`, and provenance chains as the constitutional artifacts that bound all AI work.
2.  **High-Performance Local Hardware:** Secure development and deployment machines with strong ML capabilities – e.g., Apple M1/M2 Max/Ultra systems with large unified memory. These will serve as the execution environment for running multiple LLMs locally, leveraging CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine for speed[machinelearning.apple.com](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/core-ml-on-device-llama#:~:text=Many%20app%20developers%20are%20interested,both%20memory%20and%20processing%20power). If additional compute is needed, consider on-premise GPU servers, but the design prioritizes on-device inference for privacy and latency.
3.  **Foundation LLMs (Worker Models):** A selection of large language models that can perform the tasks at hand (code generation, content creation, reasoning, etc.). These might include open-source models like Llama 2, Mistral, etc., possibly fine-tuned for our domain, and/or API models (GPT-4, Claude) if necessary. The key is that this set is **extensible** – we can add new models or replace ones as better versions come out. They should be containerized or packaged in a way that the orchestrator can invoke them uniformly.
4.  **Arbiter/Orchestrator Engine:** The core service (ideally written in Rust or C++ for efficiency) that implements the CAWS-compliant orchestration logic. This engine will handle:

    - **CAWS Policy Enforcement:** Loading and interpreting `working-spec.yaml`, budgets, waivers, and quality gates.
    - Task decomposition and assignment: deciding which model(s) to use for a given task while respecting CAWS scope boundaries.
    - Concurrency: running multiple models in parallel when beneficial (e.g., for debate or speculative execution).
    - Integration with all model backends via a common interface (calling local models via libraries or remote ones via API calls).
    - Aggregation of results: collecting outputs from workers and performing the arbitration (comparison, decision-making) against CAWS criteria.
    - Iteration/refinement: if results are not satisfactory, looping back to assign follow-up tasks or invoke other models (e.g., have a second model fix errors from the first).

5.  **Arbitration & Reasoning Module:** This could be part of the orchestrator engine or a separate sub-component (even an LLM) that focuses on evaluation of outputs against CAWS standards. It encompasses the **judge logic** – for example, a prompt template or function that takes multiple candidate outputs and scores or ranks them. It may utilize techniques like LLM debates[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-factual-consistency-with-llm-debates/#:~:text=correct,which%20summary%20choice%20is%20correct), self-consistency voting, or rule-based checks. In practice, we might implement this as:

    - A small LLM (which can run locally) designated as the "arbiter LLM" to evaluate responses against CAWS acceptance criteria, OR
    - A set of programmed heuristics/tests for known CAWS gates, combined with an optional LLM for more subtle judgments.

6.  **CAWS MCP Server Integration:** Integration with the CAWS Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes discoverable, modular tools and resources for policy enforcement, waiver management, and provenance tracking. The arbiter and worker LLMs can dynamically discover and invoke CAWS tools (validation, auditing, waiver creation, quality gates, etc.) without requiring model retraining or hardcoded tool lists. This MCP interface allows for:

    - **Tool Discovery**: Workers and arbiters can query available CAWS tools at runtime via MCP's tool discovery protocol
    - **Modular Extension**: New CAWS tools can be added to the MCP server without updating model prompts or training data
    - **Resource Access**: CAWS artifacts (working specs, provenance logs, waiver schemas) are exposed as MCP resources
    - **Standardized Interface**: All CAWS operations (verify, audit, waiver create, quality gates) are available as callable MCP tools with consistent schemas

7.  **Model Performance Tracker:** A simple database or in-memory store to record outcomes of tasks and the performance of each model (success, failure, quality rating, time taken, etc.). This will feed back into the orchestrator's routing decisions, allowing dynamic **preference for high-performing models**. Over time, this becomes a knowledge base to answer "which model is best for this type of query?". It can be as simple as a log file that is periodically analyzed, or a more active tracking system that updates a model-selection policy in real-time.
8.  **CAWS Provenance Ledger:** Every request and important action is logged with immutable CAWS provenance. This includes the prompt, chosen model, model output, CAWS verdict, waiver usage, and final result delivered. Include timestamps and CAWS-verdict-IDs for traceability. This satisfies the CAWS provenance requirements, ensuring we can audit decisions and maintain governance chains[cudocompute.com](https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/llms-ai-orchestration-toolkits-comparison#:~:text=in%20economic%20value%20by%202028,ai%20%20across%20enterprise%20workflows)[research.aimultiple.com](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-orchestration/#:~:text=,Augmented%20Generation%20%28RAG%29%20pipelines).
9.  **User/Developer Interface:** Finally, we might need interfaces to interact with this system – for developers to configure models and rules, and perhaps for users to input tasks and get results. This could be a simple CLI or API endpoint that feeds tasks into the orchestrator. While not the focus of the research, it's part of the full stack deliverable (so that the arbiter stack can be integrated into an application or pipeline easily).

With these components, the **CAWS-integrated arbiter stack** will effectively act as a constitutional authority sitting above the LLMs. Rather than a single model trying to do everything, we have a **governor + specialists** approach where CAWS becomes the executable constitution that governs all AI work. The governor (arbiter) directs specialist models and ensures every outcome complies with CAWS budgets, waivers, gates, and provenance requirements. This design is not just performant (thanks to local execution and a low-overhead orchestrator) and **modular** (we can improve or swap any part – models or logic – without overhauling the whole system), but also **governable** – every decision maps to explicit CAWS clauses, creating immutable audit trails that no model can bypass.

In conclusion, this CAWS-integrated arbiter stack transforms multi-agent orchestration from an efficiency tool into a **governance mechanism** where diligence is a first-class habit. By embedding the Coding-Agent Working Standard directly into the runtime architecture, we create a system where AI contributions are not just coordinated, but constitutionally bound. Success is defined as _passing CAWS proofs_, not "pleasing the prompt." Speed without evidence doesn't route more work; evidence-efficient models do. Back-and-forth shrinks because the first deliverable is a Plan-of-Edit; the Arbiter forbids wasteful attempts outside blast radius. Local weak models become viable: exemplars + strict proofs scaffold their performance without granting them governance.

This isn't just wrapping AI in another AI blindly – we're constructing a measured, provable, constitutional framework for machine reasoning – enforced, auditable, and local. Where traditional AI agents pursue completion, this system pursues **compliance**.

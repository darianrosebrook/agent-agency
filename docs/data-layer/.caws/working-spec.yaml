invariants:
  - Data integrity maintained during all operations
  - Vector similarity search accuracy > 90%
  - Database connections properly pooled and managed
acceptance:
  - id: DL-001
    given: PostgreSQL database with pgvector
    when: Data layer connects and performs basic operations
    then: All CRUD operations complete successfully within 100ms
  - id: DL-002
    given: Vector embeddings stored in database
    when: Similarity search executed with query vector
    then: Top 10 most similar results returned within 50ms with >90% accuracy
  - id: DL-003
    given: High concurrent load (100+ simultaneous requests)
    when: Data operations executed concurrently
    then: All operations complete without data corruption or deadlocks
  - id: DL-004
    given: Redis cache configured and operational
    when: Cached data requested multiple times
    then: Cache hit rate >95% with sub-millisecond response times

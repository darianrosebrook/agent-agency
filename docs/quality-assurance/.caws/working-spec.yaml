invariants:
  - Code quality standards maintained across all commits
  - Test coverage never decreases below established thresholds
  - Quality gates prevent deployment of non-compliant code
acceptance:
  - id: QA-001
    given: CAWS framework configured with tier definitions
    when: Code changes submitted for review
    then: Quality assessment completed within 5 minutes with clear pass/fail status
  - id: QA-002
    given: Comprehensive test suite with coverage >80%
    when: All tests executed in CI/CD pipeline
    then: Test execution completes within 10 minutes with zero critical failures
  - id: QA-003
    given: Mutation testing configured with Stryker
    when: Codebase analyzed for test quality
    then: Mutation score >70% for Tier 1 components with actionable improvement suggestions
  - id: QA-004
    given: Performance benchmarks established
    when: Code changes deployed to staging
    then: Performance regression detection identifies any >5% degradation within 30 minutes
  - id: QA-005
    given: Contract tests defined for all external APIs
    when: API changes submitted through CI/CD pipeline
    then: Contract compatibility validated within 2 minutes with zero breaking changes

ai_assessment:
  confidence_level: 0.9
  uncertainty_areas:
    - Exact test execution times for large test suites
    - False positive rates in quality gate assessments
    - Performance impact of comprehensive testing on CI/CD
  complexity_factors:
    - Multi-tier quality gate implementation
    - Comprehensive test automation across all layers
    - Integration with existing development workflows
  risk_factors:
    - Quality gates becoming too restrictive for development velocity
    - Test flakiness causing unreliable CI/CD pipelines
    - Performance overhead from comprehensive quality checks

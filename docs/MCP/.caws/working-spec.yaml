acceptance:
  - id: MCP-001
    given: MCP server running with resource and tool handlers
    when: Client requests resource list via MCP protocol
    then: Complete resource catalog returned within 1 second with proper JSON-RPC formatting
  - id: MCP-002
    given: Evaluation orchestrator configured with quality thresholds
    when: Tool execution evaluated through MCP interface
    then: Evaluation completes within 5 seconds with detailed feedback and improvement suggestions
  - id: MCP-003
    given: Satisficing logic enabled with multiple evaluation criteria
    when: Complex task executed through MCP tools
    then: Task completes with acceptable quality within 3 evaluation iterations
  - id: MCP-004
    given: Concurrent MCP clients accessing resources
    when: 10+ simultaneous requests processed
    then: All requests handled without data corruption or security breaches

### V3 E2E Test Scenarios

Based on the current v3 implementation, these end-to-end flows are operational or in development:

#### **Test 1: Council Arbitration E2E** ✅ **OPERATIONAL**
**Goal**: Verify council system can arbitrate complex decisions with evidence enrichment
- **Input**: Multi-agent task requiring arbitration
- **Process**: Council receives task → Enriches evidence → Evaluates options → Makes decision
- **Success**: Decision is well-reasoned with documented evidence and reasoning chain
- **V3 Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with advanced arbitration logic

#### **Test 2: Research Knowledge Seeking E2E** ✅ **OPERATIONAL**
**Goal**: Verify research system can seek and process knowledge from multiple sources
- **Input**: Research query requiring web scraping and vector search
- **Process**: Research system → Web scraping → Vector search → Content processing → Knowledge synthesis
- **Success**: Comprehensive knowledge base with accurate citations and relevance scoring
- **V3 Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with vector search and web scraping

#### **Test 3: Orchestration Task Routing E2E** ✅ **OPERATIONAL**
**Goal**: Verify orchestration can route tasks to appropriate workers with CAWS runtime
- **Input**: Complex task requiring multiple worker types
- **Process**: Orchestrator → Task analysis → Worker selection → CAWS runtime → Task execution
- **Success**: Task completed efficiently with proper worker coordination
- **V3 Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with CAWS runtime integration

#### **Test 4: Security Policy Enforcement E2E** ✅ **OPERATIONAL**
**Goal**: Verify security system can enforce policies and audit actions
- **Input**: Agent action requiring policy validation
- **Process**: Security enforcer → Policy check → Action validation → Audit logging
- **Success**: Policy violations detected and logged, compliant actions allowed
- **V3 Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with comprehensive policy framework

#### **Test 5: Context Preservation E2E** ✅ **OPERATIONAL**
**Goal**: Verify context system can preserve and restore multi-tenant context
- **Input**: Multi-tenant session requiring context preservation
- **Process**: Context engine → Snapshot creation → Compression → Storage → Restoration
- **Success**: Context accurately preserved and restored across sessions
- **V3 Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with multi-tenant support

#### **Test 6: Integration Performance E2E** 🟡 **IN PROGRESS**
**Goal**: Verify system performance under load with comprehensive monitoring
- **Input**: High-volume task load requiring performance validation

invariants:
  - All tasks eventually get assigned to capable agents
  - System performance doesn't degrade with memory integration
  - Agent health monitoring provides accurate status
acceptance:
  - id: AO-001
    given: Agent with memory profile registered
    when: Task submitted requiring specific capabilities
    then: Task routed to agent with highest historical success rate within 2 seconds
  - id: AO-002
    given: Multiple agents with varying performance histories
    when: Load balancing algorithm executed
    then: Tasks distributed proportionally to agent success rates with <10% variance
  - id: AO-003
    given: Agent experiencing repeated failures
    when: Health monitoring system activated
    then: Agent automatically flagged for maintenance within 5 failed tasks
  - id: AO-004
    given: System under high concurrent load (50+ tasks/minute)
    when: Memory-aware routing enabled
    then: Average task completion time improves by >15% compared to random routing

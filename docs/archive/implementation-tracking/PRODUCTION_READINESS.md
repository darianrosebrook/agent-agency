- **Logging Aggregation**: Not configured
- **Performance Optimization**: Pending
- **Load Testing**: Not completed
- **Security Hardening**: Needs validation
- **Documentation**: Incomplete

## Critical Path to Production

### MUST DO (Week 1)
1. **Fix Test Fixtures** (2-4 hours)
   - Resolve adapter configuration mismatches
   - Add agent IDs to e2e tests
   - Get test pass rate to >95%

2. **Database Validation** (4-8 hours)
   - Run against real PostgreSQL
   - Verify migrations
   - Test connection pooling under load

3. **Security Hardening** (8-16 hours)
   - Input validation testing
   - Permission/RBAC validation
   - Audit log verification

### SHOULD DO (Week 2)
4. **Deployment Pipeline** (16-24 hours)
   - CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions/GitLab)
   - Container image building
   - Automated testing in pipeline

5. **Monitoring Setup** (8-12 hours)
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alert rules

6. **Documentation** (8-12 hours)
   - API documentation (OpenAPI/GraphQL)
   - Deployment guide
   - Operational runbook

### NICE TO HAVE (Week 3+)
7. Performance optimization
8. Load testing and tuning
9. Multi-region deployment
10. Advanced security features

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Must Mitigate)
- ⚠️ **Test Fixture Compatibility**: Current test/adapter mismatches (fixable in <4 hours)
- ⚠️ **Database Under Load**: Not stress tested (must test before production)
- ⚠️ **Security Controls**: Audit trail needs validation

### Medium Risk (Should Mitigate)
- ⚠️ **Monitoring**: Only basic logging in place
- ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Framework ready but untested at scale
- ⚠️ **Performance**: No optimization done

### Low Risk (Monitor)
- Code quality (excellent)
- Architecture (sound)
- Feature completeness (good)

## Recommendations

### For MVP Release
1. **Fix Test Fixtures** - Quick wins to get pass rate to >95%
2. **Real Database Testing** - Verify PostgreSQL persistence
3. **Security Validation** - Confirm audit controls work
4. **Basic Deployment** - Simple Docker-based deployment

### For Production Release
1. **Complete Deployment Pipeline** - Full CI/CD automation
2. **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Production-grade observability
3. **Load Testing** - Verify performance under realistic load
4. **Security Audit** - Third-party security review
5. **Complete Documentation** - All operational guides done

## Conclusion

**ARBITER v2 is FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE** but requires:
1. Test infrastructure fixes (low effort, high impact)
2. Deployment automation setup (medium effort)
3. Production validation and hardening (high effort)

**Estimated Time to Production**: 2-3 weeks
**Current Completeness**: ~70% of critical path
**Go/No-Go Decision**: Ready for MVP with test fixes

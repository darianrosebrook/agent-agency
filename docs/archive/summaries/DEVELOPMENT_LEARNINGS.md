## 1. Architectural Insights

### 1.1 Council-Based Decision Making Architecture

**Learning**: The council pattern with specialized judges provides superior decision quality compared to monolithic AI evaluation.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Specialization**: Domain-specific judges (ethical, technical, operational) outperform general-purpose evaluation
- **Consensus Building**: Multi-perspective analysis reduces bias and increases decision confidence
- **Fault Tolerance**: Individual judge failures don't compromise overall assessment

**Implementation Pattern:**
```rust
// Parallel judge execution with fault tolerance
let mut handles = Vec::new();
for judge in &session.selected_judges {
    let handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
        timeout(Duration::from_secs(timeout), judge.review_spec(context)).await
    });
    handles.push(handle);
}
// Result aggregation with graceful error handling
```

### 1.2 Multi-Dimensional Risk Assessment Framework

**Weighting Algorithm:**
```rust
let mut ethical_weight = 0.25;
if ethical_risk > 0.8 {
    ethical_weight = 0.5;        // Critical ethical issues dominate
    technical_weight = 0.2;
    operational_weight = 0.15;
    business_weight = 0.15;
}
```

**Severity-Based Prioritization:**

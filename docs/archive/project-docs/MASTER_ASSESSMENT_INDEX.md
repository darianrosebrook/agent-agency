## Critical Blockers

All 6 critical security issues must be fixed before MVP deployment:

1. **Default JWT Secret** (15 min)
   - File: `src/security/AgentRegistrySecurity.ts:105`
   - Risk: Authentication bypass

2. **Mock Fallbacks** (30 min)
   - Files: `src/orchestrator/*.ts` (5 instances)
   - Risk: Privilege escalation

3. **Password Exposure** (20 min)
   - File: `src/config/AppConfig.ts:135`
   - Risk: Data breach

4. **No Rate Limiting** (45 min)
   - File: `src/security/AgentRegistrySecurity.ts`
   - Risk: Brute force attacks

5. **HTTPS Not Enforced** (45 min)
   - Files: MCP server, API endpoints
   - Risk: MITM attacks

6. **Task Validation Missing** (60 min)
   - File: `src/orchestrator/TaskOrchestrator.ts`
   - Risk: Code injection

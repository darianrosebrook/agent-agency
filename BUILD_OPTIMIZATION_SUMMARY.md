# Setup all optimizations
./scripts/setup-distributed-cache.sh
./scripts/setup-tmpfs.sh

# Source environment
source ~/.config/agent-cache.env
source ~/.config/tmpfs.env
```

### **Development Workflow**
```bash

# Python (DSPy integration)
cd python-services/dspy-integration
uv sync --dev        # Fast dependency management
make test-parallel   # Parallel test execution
make optimize-parallel  # CPU-bound parallel processing

# Rust (v3)
cd ../../v3
make build-dev       # With timing and caching
make timing-report   # View performance metrics
